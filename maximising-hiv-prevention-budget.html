            <h2 id="probsol">Problem Brief</h2>
            <p class="text">Provide suggestions for how resources should be allocated between different HIV prevention strategies: behavioural strategies, 
                strategies aimed at injecting drug users (IDUs) and strategies aimed at preventing mother-to-child (MTC) transmission in 2020. 
                The total budget is allocated for HIV treatment and prevention. All persons living with HIV must be treated and only the 
                remainder of the funding can be used for HIV prevention. This must be allocated appropriately to prevent the maximum number of 
                HIV cases.</p>

            <p class="text underimage">It was predicted that in 2020 HIV diagnosis and related deaths would decrease to 2,938 and 118 cases respectively, and 
                those receiving treatment would increase to 92,245 people. The cost of treating each person is &pound;10,000/year, and treatment must be 
                provided to every person seeking it. Given a proposed budget of &pound;900M for HIV treatment and prevention, the cost of treatment exceeds 
                the proposed budget by &pound;22,450,000 - the budget is insufficient. Based on predicted numbers of those seeking treatment and prevention 
                objectives, the following budget ranges are suggested: </p>

            <p class="text">The range between the 'Minimum Cumulative Budget' and 'Maximum Cumulative Budget' is the amount needed to treat 1 case up to all cases for 
                each Prevention Method (and all Treatment and Prevention Methods listed before it). Considering that the main objective is to maximise 
                averting new HIV cases, preference was given to prevention methods in the order of Injecting Drug Users, Mother to Child, and lastly 
                Behaviour Prevention. Maximise averting new HIV cases meant addressing the cheapest prevention method first and then systematically moving 
                onto the next method in increasing order of cost per prevented case. The cheaper the cost of an individual case, the more cases that can be 
                averted.</p>
            <p class="text">Even though Behavioural Prevention has the highest cost per prevention method and prioritizing it seems to deviate from the main objective, 
                there is a higher success rate of averting those who have been exposed through behaviour. In 2009, 91% of newly diagnosed cases said they 
                were exposed to HIV through behavioural contact; in 2018, that metric decreased to 78%. In comparison, both MTC and IDU transmission did 
                not see much distribution change. IDU and MTC transmission target niche subgroups while behavioural addresses a much wider group within 
                the population. Behavioural Prevention methods can have carried-forward effects - for example if a young female were taught to be safe 
                while sexually active, she can avoid contraction and the potential to transfer it to her offspring, therefore lowering that budget needed 
                for MTC Prevention in the future. There is also an opportunity to segment behavioural prevention costs, for example sex education in schools. 
                Teaching adolescents to be aware and cautious of contracting HIV can potentially be cheaper than educating those who currently are not part 
                of an education system.</p>
            <p class="text">Over a 10-year period of 2009 to 2018 HIV diagnosis has decreased by 34.69%, deaths due to HIV have decreased 71.54%, and those living with 
                HIV who are receiving treatment has increased 45.54%. These changes are a direct result of improved medications and the decrease in stigma 
                against being HIV positive and prevention strategies.</p>
            <p class="text">In summary, the minimum budget needed to only treatment those seeking HIV-related healthcare is &pound;922,450,000, and the maximum needed to 
                potentially prevent all expected new cases of HIV is &pound;950,198,500. When the budget is incrementally increased, to maximise the number of 
                cases averted the prevention strategies must be addressed in the order IDU, MTC, then Behavioural, addressing all cases within each before 
                moving onto to the next. Priority should not be given purely based on maximising immediately avertable cases, and weight should be added 
                to the different prevention methods to add another layer of priority.</p>

            <h3>Predictive Models</h3>
            <p class="text explanation">Quadratic & Linear models  were used to predict 2019 and 2020 numbers for number of new HIV
                 Diagnosis, number of Deaths, the number of those seen for care, and women between the ages of 25-49 diagnosed with HIV</p>
            
            <h4>Dataset: New Diagnosis</h4>
            <p class="text">Linear, Quadratic, Polynomials of Order 3 and 4, and Logarithmic models were tested to create the model New Diagnosis. The Linear and Logarithmic 
                models produced near identical results, while the Quadratic and Polynomial Models produced results non-distinct from one another when review 
                predictions up to 2020. Due to the similarities creating 2 subsets within the model, the Linear and Quadratic models were further tested by 
                comparing the sum of squares of the residual values. The Quadratic Model's sum of squares was half that of the Linear model, which led to the 
                selection of using it to predict years 2019 and 2020. However, this model is invalid for predicting results after year 2020 (as the steep decline 
                quickly shows negative numbers). Likewise models of higher order exponentially decreased at much faster rates.</p>
            <img class="predictionmodels" src="data-analysis-resources/Diagnosis.png">
        
            <h4 class="underimage">Dataset: Death</h4>
            <p class="text">Linear and Quadratic models were created and tested to predict future death rates. Even though the Quadratic model's sum of squares produced better 
                results for predicting the existing years 2009 to 2018, the model predicted negative results for the year 2020 (which would have also been true 
                for polynomial models of higher order). This leaves the Linear model as the more suitable one for predicting data for years 2019 and 2020.</p>
            <img class="predictionmodels" src="data-analysis-resources/Deaths.png">

            <h4 class="underimage">Dataset: Treatment & Women Diagnosed between ages 25-49</h4>
            <p class="text">While modeling Diagnosis it became clear that higher order polynomials produced better predictions for existing years (2009-2018), but generally 
                performed poorly at predicting future dates. Additionally, graphed data for treatment and women diagnosed exhibited near-linear plots, so an assumption 
                was made that models of higher polynomials would not produce better predictions for the years 2019 and 2020. Consequently, only Quadratic and Linear 
                models were used to model datasets for Treatment and Women Diagnosed between ages 25-49. In both cases the Quadratic model produced better results for 
                the sum of squares. For Treatment Models the sum of squares for the Quadratic model was 22% that of the Linear model, and for Women Diagnosed between 
                ages 25-49 sum of squares for the quadratic model was half that of the linear model.</p>
