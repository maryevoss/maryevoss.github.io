            <h3 id="questionone">Abstract</h3>
            <p class="text">The use of operational research to solve developmental problems in developing countries first began in the 1950s, 
                but the first official global meeting for this purpose was not held until 1992. Since then the OR community has been making 
                strides with using operational research to support developing countries. The benefits of operational research have been 
                experienced across the globe and in diverse applications. One such application is improving energy supply for the ever growing 
                energy demands in Beijing, China and India. Both studies seek a more evolved understanding of the uncertainties of resource 
                supply and energy demand so that educated decisions can be made to develop energy systems in their respective countries.</p>

        <!--INTRODUCTION-->

        <section class="intro">
            <h3 class="sect">1. Introduction</h3>
            <p class="text">In the past, the term 'developing country' has been used as a catch all for all those that are not developed or 
                undeveloped. Countries in this category do not share many qualities, there is no precise characteristic shared amongst them all 
                (Pritchett, 1997). The World Bank categorises countries into 4 groups based on their Gross National Income, and the 
                International Monetary Fund has two divisions: Advanced Economies, and Emerging and Developing Economies. It can be surmised 
                that classifying countries as 'Developed', 'Developing', and 'Under Developed' is antiquated. For the purpose of this review 
                any country that does not have an advanced economy or high income per capita will be defined as 'developing'.</p>

            <p class="text">The relationship between Operational Research and Developing Countries is thought to have begun at latest in the 
                late 1950s (Bornstein and Rosenhead, 1990). Over forty years later in December 1992, the first International Conference on OR 
                for Development took place in Ahmedabad, India. The meeting culminated with the notion to use Operational Research as a tool 
                to further development and economic advancement in 'developing' countries (Whitea et al., 2011).</p>
            
            <p class="text">However, there are several challenges with utilising and implementing operational research techniques in 'developing' 
                countries. For instance, without human capital, developing countries would not have the local specialist needed to conduct such 
                research. This lack of resource can be tied to not having the proper education or brain drain of those who do. Wide-spread brain 
                drain is closely associated with having an adverse impact on economic development (Docquier et al., 2007). Another consideration 
                is access to big data, the role of which many countries and business leaders are important in propelling development forward 
                (Long & Brindley, 2013). But poor data infrastructure, and inadequately trained personnel are hurdles that developing countries 
                must overcome before they can benefit from big data (Luna et al., 2014). Lastly, technological progress is a must-have to join 
                the ranks of countries with advanced economies (Petralia et al., 2017), without which operational research can only do so much 
                to support developing countries with industrial development and economic growth.</p>

            <p class="text">In 2015 at a United Nations conference, 195 nations agreed upon 17 sustainability goals that they would like to 
                achieve by 2030. Some of these goals include climate action, good-health and wellbeing, and sustainable cities and communities. 
                This paper begins by exploring how operational research techniques have and can be used to help achieve some of these 
                sustainability goals, while the main literature review will focus on 'Planning Energy Systems in Developing Countries' 
                (specifically India, and Beijing, China).</p>

            <h3 class="sect">2. Areas of Research</h3>


            <h3 class="sect1 blue ital">2.1 Allocating Healthcare Professionals</h3>

            <p class="text">Regardless of the development status of a country a shortage of healthcare professionals is a universal problem. 
                In Haryana India there is not only a lack of doctors, but the quantity of doctors allocated to health centres are not 
                distributed based on the needs of the area, and there is problem with sporadic absenteeism from many doctors. Circumstantially, 
                it is not easy to numerate the probability of absenteeism. To tackle these issues, a heuristic encompassing linear programming 
                is constructed to maximise the number of patients attended to by doctors each day (Goyal and Yadav, 1979).</p>
            
            <p class="text">Focusing on their emergency department, a government hospital in Kuwait also wants to maximise the number of 
                patients seen. Ahmed and Alkhamis (2008) go a step further by simulating the process a patient would go through upon 
                entering the emergency department until their dismissal. Combining the simulation model with a discrete stochastic 
                optimisation model, Ahmed and Alkhamis (2008) optimise the quantity of nurses, doctors and lab technicians needed in the 
                emergency department.</p>
            
            <p class="text">In poverty-stricken Haiti, mortality rates are high and communities rely on healthcare workers (not doctors). 
                Parker et al. (1988) aim to maximise "health "benefit" to a regional population"; benefits are specified as decreased mortality 
                rates and optimised time spent treating various health issues. The limitations on healthcare workers, finances and other 
                resources lead Parker et al. (1988) to handle this as a resource allocation problem.</p>


            <h3 class="sect2 blue ital">2.2 Balancing Nutrients in Local Diets</h3>

            <p class="text">Children in many developing countries suffer from malnutrition. To achieve the World Health Organisations 
                recommendations of improved feeding practices. Ferguson et al. (2006) used goal programming to optimise diets based on local 
                ingredients and cuisine that meet the numerous nutritional needs of children. The technique of goal programming is quite 
                fitting for addressing this problem; as Romero (1991, pg ix) describes, "Goal Programming attempts to combine the logic of 
                optimisation in mathematical programming with the decision makers' desire to satisfy several goals."</p>
            
            <p class="text">Over the years Mathematical Programming has become a common technique for solving diet problems, whether they be 
                malnourished children, feeding soliders in war or educating adults on having a balanced diet (van Dooren, 2018). With the 
                intention of education mothers of infants in West Lombok, Indonesia about feeding their children key nutrients (zinc, calcium, 
                niacin and iron); Fahmida et al. (2015) developed a linear programming model to create complimentary feeding recommendations 
                (CFRs) to supplement the missing nutrients.</p>

            
            <h3 class="sect2 blue ital">2.3 Transportation Pollution</h3>

            <p class="text">Growing populations in dense urban cities intensify the fight for space. Businesses such as manufacturers and 
                warehouser that need a lot of it are all now located outside of cities. To get their goods in, freight trains (and other modes 
                of transport) are used. Freight trains discharge copious amounts of noise pollution, air pollution, and greenhouse gases that 
                are unsustainable and harmful to both people and the environment. In the past, the optimisation of freight train schedules and 
                networks did not include consideration for pollution and sustainability. Bandeira et al. (2018) proposed using a fuzzy 
                multi-criteria decision making approach to confront these issues of pollution and sustainability and to suggest a less harmful 
                approach to distribution chains and urban deliveries. In Tehran, the scope is broadened a little to include the transportation 
                of passengers on a railway. The fuel consumption of both these trains have unsustainable amounts of carbon emission. Using a 
                mixed integer nonlinear model, Miandoab et al. (2019) suggest carbon emissions can be decreased by optimising the schedule 
                taking into consideration the carbon emission factor related to weight and prioritisation of trains.</p>


            <h3 class="sect2 blue ital">2.4 Disaster Relief</h3>

            <p class="text">Natural disasters spawn damage and uncertainty. When they strike, residents of communities and even countries may 
                be displaced from their homes. Turkey is one such country that is susceptible to natural disasters that cause its citizens to 
                become homeless overnight. To aid in these catastrophes governments need to have procedures in place to quickly assemble 
                temporary shelters to house citizens. Using mixed integer linear programming, Kilci et al. (2014) were able to select ideal 
                locations for temporary shelters. </p>

            <p class="text">Basic goods such as food and clothing also suddenly become inaccessible. It is difficult, to be fully prepared for a 
                disaster, but preparatory measures to the fullest extent must be put in place to ensure these resources are available. Khayal et 
                al. (2015, p.22) propose using "a network flow model for dynamic selection temporary distribution facilities and allocation of 
                resources for emergency response planning", in which excess resources are transferred between facilities in response to disasters.</p>

            <h3 class="sect">3. Planning Energy Systems</h3>


            <h3 class="sect1 blue ital">3.1 Defining The Problem</h3>

            <p class="text">Modern day society has become dependent on electricity, so much so that at this rate supply cannot meet demand. 
                Population sizes are continuously increasing, thereby requiring higher quantities of supplied energy and more planning for 
                the provision of energy sources in the present and future. As societies all around the globe continue to grow technologically 
                and in population size, reliance on products that need to be fuelled by energy is exponentially increasing- from lighting 
                homes at night to powering manufacturing facilities.</p>

            <p class="text">How two different societies have chosen to approach this supply shortage will be reviewed and compared within this 
                report. They are described in'Production and maintenance planning for electricity generators: modelling and application to 
                Indian power systems,' by Chattopadhyay (2001), and 'An interval full-infinite mixed-integer programming method for planning 
                municipal energy systems- A case study of Beijing' by Zhu et al. (2011). </p>

            <p class="text">In both instances the overarching goal is to improve planning and production of energy supplies, but on a granular 
                level they differ from one another. Chattopadhyay (2001) focuses on optimising currently available resources for no more than a 
                year into the future. The commissioners of the research also stated that it is of utmost importance to maintain the existing 
                distribution of planned outages while minimising cost is secondary. Conversely, Zhu et al. (2011) have been permitted much more 
                flexibility- if additional resources are needed they will be allocated. Additionally, the objective function is defined by 
                minimising costs  while taking into consideration limits on pollution, machinery depreciation, supply costs, selling prices, 
                capacity expansion, etc.</p>

            <p class="text">Though this review focuses on cases in India and Beijing it is a common global issue. Both of the reviewed 
                approaches use a form of linear programming to solve their version of planning energy systems. The studies were conducted over a 
                decade apart and in different parts of the world, but their main objectives still remain the same- how to supply energy when 
                demand is both uncertain and increasing, and natural resources are finite.</p>


            <h3 class="sect2 blue ital">3.2 Power Systems in India</h3>

            <h3 class="sect1b italthin">3.2.1 Introduction to Full Problem</h3>

            <p class="text">Year over year, demand for energy has increased by over 10% in India. Annual seasonal patterns can be found within 
                the data, and throughout each individual day there is a wide range in difference between peak and low energy usage. During daily 
                peaks, approximately 20% of those who need energy go without, because current supply cannot meet such a high demand. Other times 
                when citizens are without electricity it is because there is a power outage. The Northern Regional Electricity Board (NREB) 
                groups these outages into two categories: planned and unplanned. Planned outages occur when transmission networks are shut off 
                for maintenance, and unplanned (also called forced) outages can happen for various reasons such as a faulty wire. </p>
                
            <p class="text">Within a 36-year period, India's energy production capacity has increased by 44.44x since 1961. If increase was 
                steady from year to year, each year's capacity grew by 11.12%. To create energy, India depends on coal (62%) and hydropower 
                (28%) as fuel supplies. The Norther Regional Electricity Board supplies electricity to seven states; their transmission network 
                consists of 238 interconnected generating units. </p>

            <p class="text"></p>

            <p class="text">The NREB performs annual research to plan ahead for the coming year. There are three outcomes they are most 
                interested in: a) a review of the current energy process, b) a proposal for potential improvements, c) a demonstration of the 
                effectiveness of b. Though their main purpose is not to focus on specifically addressing the energy supply shortage, it is 
                modelled this way.</p>

            <div class="image">

                <p class="graphcap">Figure 1. Diagram of Energy Creation Process and the sub-problems associated with each area.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="text">To produce the outcomes outlined, Chattopadhyay (2001) analyses the entire energy production process and outlines 
                the subproblems. The diagram below displays the system's process and which subproblems are associated with which subsystems.</p>

            <h3 class="sect2b blue italthin">3.2.2 Model Summary</h3>
            <p class="text">A six-step method was developed by Chattopadhyay (2001) to optimise the maintenance schedule and minimise costs. 
                It is as follows:</p>
            <ol class="outer">
                <li class="text">Generators are to an extent randomly sampled, in a manner that will create a maintenance plan that can handle a large number 
                    generators that frequently lose power. The current maintenance schedule is considered when pooling which generators should 
                    be sampled first, and generators that experience forced (unplanned) power outages most frequently are sample first.</li>
                <li class="text">Each sample set is used as input into the multi-objective relaxed LP one at a time. The LP   has two objective functions: 
                    i) minimise total cost of system denoted by 'COST' and ii) minimise the variance of expected energy shortage denoted by 
                    'VAR'. COST is not of too much importantance to the NREB unless there is a significant decrease. The second objective 
                    function VAR is of utmost importance as the NREB would like to continue uniformly distributing planned outages in the manner 
                    deemed most fair. Chattopadhyay then combines the two objective functions (COST/VAR) using Compromise Programming which was 
                    proposed by Zeleny (1982). The output of the relaxed LP is an approximated maintenance plan for those generators within the 
                    random sample along with recommended fuel supply, generation and transmission flow variables for each generator. 
                    Unfortunately this maintenance plan is not ideal because it does not ensure:</li>
                    <ol class="inner">
                        <li class="text">That too many generators within one plant are being scheduled for maintenance simultaneously (this should be 
                            avoided)</li>
                        <li class="text">Maintenance won't be scheduled during peak demand </li>
                    </ol>
                <li class="text">To adjust for the faults of the LP model, a heuristic is used. The heuristic utilises all the outputs from the LP model 
                    to create a viable order for the maintenance plan.</li>
                <li class="text">Now that the maintenance plan has been established it becomes a fixed variable, and the three other outputs (fuel supply, 
                    quantity generated and transmission flow) from the initial LP can be optimised based on the maintenance plan. The original 
                    LP is updated by removing the maintenance constraints as they're now obsolete. A new constraint and its associated 
                    variables PEAK, EUP and UFIC are added for monthly peak demand. The constraint "implicitly assumes a unit to be 
                    unavailable during the occurrence of the peak-load condition even if it is on maintenance for a small fraction of time" 
                    (Chattopadhyay, 2001, p.482).</li>
                <li class="text">Steps 1 to 4 are repeated until all generators have been selected</li>
                <li class="text">The expected outcome is computed by combining all sample sets</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="text">To recap, the first is a relaxed linear programming model to create an initial maintenance schedule. That initial 
                maintenance schedule is not considered ideal based on the criteria that every region must experience maintenance power outages 
                equally, so the schedule is further developed using a heuristic. Once the maintenance plan is established it is used in the 
                second LP, which optimises for overall cost and 'variance of expected energy shortage over the 12 months' (Chattopadhyay, 2001).</p>

            <p class="text">Within the sample set, each generating unit has an associated vector containing its maintenance schedule that was 
                recommended in step 2. An example vector is [0.2, 0.3, 0, 0.5] which indicates maintenance work for this specific generator will 
                be completed in four months with the first 20% of maintenance completed in month one. The maintenance schedule is reviewed and 
                based on a detailed set of criteria is decided whether to be kept or if it should be replanned so that the overall sample set's 
                schedule can be better optimised (Chattopahyay, 2001). The heuristic is not expected to produce the most optimum results, but 
                is used because it better addresses the NREB's focus on uniformly distributing planned (maintenance) power outages. The outcome 
                of the heuristic is a fixed maintenance schedule within the sample set.</p>

            <ol class="outer">
                <li class="text">Constraint #4, which specifies how long a generator can perform for before needing maintenance, and constraint #5, which

                <li class="text">A new constraint is added: <span class="inline_eq">\((PEAK)_{i,m} + EUP_{i,m} =\)

                    used to better understand production capacity especially during peak demand by assuming a unit is entirely unavailable if 
                    there is any period of maintenance during peak-load time. Chattopadhyay (2001) is aware that this constraint may shrink 
                    power availability within the model, and so it is adjustable.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="sect2b blue italthin">3.2.3 Outcomes and Suggestions</h3>
            <p class="text">Compared to the previous approach of modelling the NREB's energy system Chattopadhyay's (2001) approach was more 
                interconnected in terms of optimising for all the decision variables. System costs were lowered by redistributing which coal
                mines will be fuel supplies for power plants and by generating more energy in power plants where cost/MWh 
                was lower and then transferring the energy to other areas. Overall it was estimated to decrease total cost by approximately 
                10% - approximately Rs 4.470 million and all four sub problems previously outlined have been addressed.</p>
            <p class="text">The cost objective function does not include costs for machinery depreciation or maintenance which decreases the 
                accuracy of the model because it is unlikely the NREB will actually save that much money. Loss of load is mentioned in the 
                monthly energy demand constraint, but it should be used better. Loss of load can be used as a measure of reliability (Kaldellis, 
                2010); decreasing shortages to increase reliability of the system should an objective of the NREB, not just maintaining the 
                current distribution. Though cost is a great way to enumerate improvements, reliability would have been better so that less 
                people can go without energy shortages. Volkanovski et al. (2008) minimised the loss of load probability in "Genetic algorithm 
                optimisation of the maintenance scheduling of generating units in a power system". This can be used in a goal programming 
                method so that the focus is on meeting a minimum improvement level.</p>
            <p class="text">The outcomes of Chattopadhyay's (2001) model prove that it is more efficient to increase production at some power 
                plants and transfer the energy to demand nodes in other areas. Transmission capacity is a constraint caused by the physical 
                power lines. It may be worth while to improve these. </p>
            
            <h3 class="sect2 ital">3.3 Planning Municipal Energy Systems in Beijing</h3>
            <h3 class="sect1b italthin">3.3.1 Introduction to Full Problem</h3>
            <p class="text">In Beijing, research is focused on the long term planning of their energy systems. At the highest level their 
                problem focuses on three main aspects: growing demand, scarce resources and environmental damage (both the present and future). 
                The fast growth of demand is demonstrated by the rate of change in energy consumption: it measured 63.4 million tonnes of coal 
                in 2008, 1.5 times higher than in 2001. Beijing itself does not have the fuel supply resources it needs to generate energy 
                supply. These resource limitations and additional infrastructural limitations have forced Beijing to import a portion of their 
                energy supply from nearby provinces at higher costs, and subject to conditions such as availability of excess supply and 
                'cost-barrier of transmission infrastructure' (Zhu et al., 2011).</p>
            <p class="text">Importance is placed on meeting demand, whether it is by increasing capacity or by importing higher-cost energy. 
                The latter is more of a temporary solution, as Beijing plans to expand capacity and decrease air pollutants by installing 
                clean-coal-fired, natural-gas-fired, landfill-gas-fired, and wind-power generation facilities. They would undoubtedly prefer 
                to shift more of their energy supply to renewable resources to be more environmentally friendly, but the needed technologies 
                and capacities are not yet available (Zhu et al., 2011).</p>
            <p class="text">This research concentrates on understanding and updating energy demand and supply usage patterns, which will support 
                planning and expansion projects while managing economic cost versus environmental friendliness. Or, in Zhu et al.'s (2011) words, 
                'how to effectively alloc-ate energy and decide how to expand to minimise the net system cost'. The subproblems are as follows:</p>
            <ol class="outer letters">
                <li class="text">Build an energy model based on methods mentioned in the next section</li>
                <li class="text">Create a method that can include capacity expansion schemes inclusive of uncertainties</li>
                <li class="text">Utilise outcome to inform Beijing on energy system planning and environmental management</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="sect2b italthin">3.3.2 Model Summary</h3>
            <p class="text">Facility capacity, production efficiency, resource availability and allocation are all uncertainties that play 
                significant roles within the model. Zhu et al. (2011) explore various methods of addressing the unpredictability of these 
                uncertainties. They first examine Interval-Parameter Programming (IPP), which uses crisp intervals (a,b), but it does not 
                provide the flexibility needed of the constraints to cope with uncertainties. IPP is regularly used in cases of uncertainty 
                in the provision of utilities; a successful case of this was by Zarghami et al. (2015) to solve for the uncertainties 
                involved with allocating water.</p>
            <p class="text">In the end, Zhu et al. (2011) selected an interval full-finite mixed-integer programming method to deal with the 
                complex uncertainties and intricacies of expanding capacity. Its upper and lower bounds are defined by functional intervals, 
                thereby making the model solvable because they are sensitive enough to the uncertainty of the inputs (Zhu et al., 2011). 
                The final model is considered an 'Interval Full-Infinite Mixed-Integer Municipal-Scale Energy Model' (IFMI-MEM), and it 
                contains both crisp and functional intervals. </p>
            <p class="text">The objective function's (Figure 2) complicated structure is a result of there being 18 different conversion 
                technologies (methods) for generating electricity and heat. Within the function, revenue from selling electricity to other 
                provinces and financial subsidies for pollution emissions are the only two sources of income. The function begins with the 
                cost to purchase resources that will be converted into electricity and heat supply. Additionally, there are operational 
                costs inclusive of machinery depreciation which is relative to specific time periods, conversion technologies and quantities 
                of heat and electricity generated. For each conversion technology and energy type generated, there is a binary capacity 
                expansion option  that allows supply to meet the increased energy demand, giving Beijing the option of optimising the model 
                with or without the expansion. Other expenses include transmission costs of electricity and pollution emission penalty costs. </p>
            <p class="text">The 18 conversion technologies are represented within the function as <span class="ital">n</span> = 1,...,18. 
                <span class="ital">n</span> =1,...,9 are within electric power plants, <span class="ital">n</span> =10,11,12 in thermal power 
                plants, and <span class="ital">n</span> =13,...,18 in heat plants, <span class="ital">L</span> = 5 years. Though the system 
                is representative of costs over the next 15 years it can be easily adjusted for any number of years (if criteria remains the same).</p>

            <h3 class="sect2b italthin">3.3.3 Outcome and Suggestions</h3>
            <p class="text">The objective function's outcome is total cost of the system over 15 years \(f_{opt}^\pm\)= RMB&yen;[709.14, 3208.25] x 
                1012. The range of the results is attributed to the range of the interval inputs; the lower and upper bounds of the outcome are 
                the product of parameters either all at the lower bound or all at the upper bound. Zhu et al (2011) describes the spectrum of 
                cost to be the "tradeoffs between system costs and reliability." As is expected, there is a positive relationship between system 
                costs and reliability. Furthermore, "the model can be used for examining the relations between system cost and resource 
                availability." Ultimately, the lower bound represents the lowest cost the system may have to still produce sufficient results, 
                but to gain more reliability costs will increase.</p>
            <p class="text">Interval results in period <span class="ital">k</span> = 1,2,3 are for the following variables:</p>
                <ol class="outer">
                    <li class="text">Local energy supply for <span class="ital">i</span> = 1,..., 13 where <span class="ital">i</span> is energy/resource purchased</li>

                </ol>
            <p class="text">The only financial constraint was on capacity expansion. This resulted in there being an approximately 2.5 
                quadrillion renminbi difference between the lower and upper bounds of the objective output. With such a variation it seems as 
                though it would make decision-making difficult. To further decision-making it would be beneficial to extend this project to use 
                multi-criteria decision making to finalise which is the best course of action. In Algeria, Haddad et al. (2017) used this 
                approach to decide which concept would be best for transforming their energy system from exclusively relying on fossil fuels to 
                also including non-renewable energies.</p>
            <p class="text">As China's energy demands continue to grow so do air pollutants - SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>. 
                In China, 90% of SO<sub>2</sub> and 67% NO<sub>x</sub> emissions are caused by coal (Chen & Xu, 2010).If the same types of 
                resources and conversion methods continue to be used as demand grows air pollution will inevitably worsen. Zhu et al. (2011) 
                mentioned that the 'environmental protection goal' will force the reduction of coal-fired and gas-fired energy production, 
                and the government has shown interest in expanding their use of natural gas which has lower pollution emissions. Alternatively, 
                mixtures of coal and biomass have been shown to reduce pollutants SO<sub>2</sub> by up to 7-12% and NO<sub>x</sub> by 45% 
                (Narayanan & Natarjan, 2006). </p>
            <p class="text">China makes a lot of effort to invest in clean-coal and renewable resources research. This model only uses 
                traditional forms of energy conversion (Zhu et al., 2011). In a way, this makes the model outdated. If the model is to plan for 
                the coming 15 years, it should include non-traditional sources of energy as an option like it does with the binary capacity 
                expansion. Clean energy is currently more expensive than non-renewable energies, and so it may be useful to analyse how much 
                more expensive clean energy is per MWh. </p>
            <p class="text">Lastly, a major flaw in this model is that it does not include peak energy demand or peak energy supply. If the model 
                cannot realistically plan for when the energy system is most strained, it is unlikely to meet the needs of energy demand and 
                contribute enough to solving the energy crisis in Beijing.</p>

        <section class="comparison">
            <h3 class="sect2 ital">3.4 Comparison of Methods</h3>
            <p class="text">To recap, the two models aim to close the gap on energy demand shortages through planning, but proceed to do so very 
                differently. For the NREB in India, the distribution of planned shortages must be allocated fairly, and their outlook is only up 
                to the coming year. In Beijing, the model encompasses the next 15 years; it includes opportunities for expanding energy supply 
                capacity, and places emphasis on reducing air pollution.</p>
            <p class="text">Both models are based on linear programming techniques. Uncertainty is a shared common theme that has been dealt with 
                very differently. Chattopadhyay (2001) uses Monte Carlo simulation to model the random power outages that are of probabilistic 
                nature, while Zhu et al. (2011) use functional intervals to capture the range of uncertainty expected in resource supply, future 
                demand, etc. Furthermore, their constraints reflect their similarities and differences. They each host equations for energy 
                supply, resources supply, transmission, energy demand and mass balance constraints, but maintenance, environmental impact, and 
                funding constraints are not shared by the two.</p>
            <p class="text">Neither model seems to be holistically complete. As mentioned before, Chattopadhyay (2001) does not include all 
                costs within the cost objective function, and Zhu et al. (2011) do not consider peak demand or supply. So, albeit useful these 
                models probably should not be given full trust.</p>

        <section class="conclusion">
            <h3 class="sect2 ital">3.5  Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="text">Energy supply is an ongoing problem many countries face. Cheaper sources of energy production come at the cost of 
                the environment and citizens' health. Though research is being done to convert to less harmful energy supply, one of the 
                adversities to transitioning is increased cost and who will be responsible for bearing it. </p>
            <p class="text">It is likely that energy supply will remain an ongoing issue for many countries. It is not an easy task to predict 
                the uncertainties of future demand or be able to prepare for it. Within the energy system there are many subsystems which pose 
                as risks to meeting demand such as resource availability, technology and capacity. </p>
            <p class="text">Linear Programming has proven to be a versatile modelling method that can be manipulated to address a variety of 
                problems.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="overall">
            <h3 class="sect">4. Overall Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="text">Developing Countries can benefit from methods of operational research. In the past mathematicians have used 
                operational research to assist with alleviating child malnutrition, allocating health professionals, easing pollution from 
                transportation, and many other problems. Unfortunately, past successes are not enough to always motivate using operational 
                research in developing countries. Other than a lack of financial resources there are several challenges obstructing developing 
                countries from moving towards using operational research. They may not have the skilled human capital to model the research 
                or build the infrastructure needed to host necessary data. It is also an unfortunate fact that corruption is prevalent in many 
                developing countries, and optimising processes may not be to the benefit of those involved. If developing countries are to 
                advance governments of these countries must shoulder the responsibility of being the driving force of the imperative cultural 
                changes.</p>
