                    <h2 id="questionone">Problem Brief</h2>
                    <p class="text">ABC NHS Trust provides medical services for around half a million people. The focus here is on inpatient, non-
                        emergency services such as surgery for a given medical specialty.</p>
                    <p class="text">The Department of Health has defined the Referral to Treatment Time (RTT) as a key performance measure; this is 
                        the time from a patient's referral to the start of treatment. Each patient arrives at ABC having already waited 
                        (the time since referral) a time called Elasped Time Since Referral (ETSR). Only the ABC system will be the time 
                        from arrival at ABC to treatment at ABC, a patient's RTT = ETSR + W.</p>
                    <p class="text">Patients are classified as either urgent (U) or routine (R). Inter-arrival times are assumed to be independent and 
                        exponentially distributed. The rate of arrivals, per day is 3.69 for urgent and 2.19 for routine. Recall that the 
                        mean inter-arrival time is the time it takes (on average) for one arrival, and is the inverse of the arrival rate 
                        (the number of arrivals per unit time, on average). Service (treatment) times are constant (fixed) and equal to 
                        1/6 days.</p>
                    <p class="text">ETSR is modelled as follows: for <span class="bold">R patients, it has a Normal Distribution with mean 70 days and standard Deviation 
                        15 days</span> (negative samples may be reset to zero; for simplicity this is not required); for <span class="bold">U patients it has 
                        an Exponential Distribution with mean 50 days.</span> Services is given according to the following priority rule:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="text">U patients have priority over R ones</li>
                        <li class="text">Within each type (U, R) priority is given to those with higher ETSR</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text">This priority rule is complete (ties are virtually impossible): since both ETSR distributions are continuous, the 
                        probability that any two patients have the same ETSR is zero. We aim for a basic simulation in which patients are 
                        treated as Simul8's generic items (patients' appointments are not modelled). <span class="bold">Output of interests 
                        are: (1) The fraction of patients whose RTT is no more than 18 weeks, (2) The effect of the priority rule on average 
                        waiting times. Specifically for each case, U and R, let x denote the ETSR as follows: x \(\leq\) F-1 (1/3) is small (S); 
                        x > F-1 (2/3) is large (L); otherwise it is medium (M). We want to estimate the mean waiting time at ABC (the W above) 
                        for each of the six categories formed by the patient types (U, R) and ETSR categories (S, M, L).</span></p>
                    <p class="text">These outputs refer to long-run behaviour (steady state), but early parts of a simulation tend to depend heavily on 
                        the choice of initial system state (that is, at time zero). Thus: assume the initial system state is "empty"; use a 
                        warm-up of 200 days; and exclude the data observed during the warm-up. For consistency, all times should be measured 
                        in days.</p>

                    <p class="text underimage">Two trials each consisting of 500 runs were conducted: one at a 95% confidence interval level and the other at 99%. 
                        There was a warmup period of 200 days, and each run lasted 2000 days. The trials produced near identical results

                    <p class="text">Considering that 'patients seen within 18 weeks' is a KPI, results show there is room for improvement. In the case 
                        of priority rules, there was an insignificant difference amongst those categorized as urgent. Conversely, the gap 
                        between the shortest Routine average waiting time and the longest Urgent average waiting time is approximately 1.14 
                        hours. Amongst Routine patients Medium waited 42 minutes longer than Large. However, those in Routine-Small have a 
                        drastically longer waiting time of a day and a third (over a day longer than any other patient type). This waiting 
                        period needs to be improved, both in comparison to the other 5 categories, and because it is longer than a day.</p>
