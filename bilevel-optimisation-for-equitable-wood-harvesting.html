            <h3 id="questionone">Abstract</h3>

            <p class="text">Malawian's dependence on forest products and agricultural demands have led to detrimental
                levels of deforestations. Their primary use of wood products is wood fuel for heating and
                cooking, although the government would prefer for citizens switch to alternatives the majority of
                people cannot afford other sources of fuel. Customary lands were the first forested areas to feel
                the effects of deforestation; now that they are depleted rural villagers are turning to government
                land of forest reserves. The government of Malawi introduced community based systems to
                include villagers in sharing the responsibility of combatting deforestation. A case study is
                performed on villages left of the Namizimu Forest Reserve where leaders from the villages form
                a committee to allocate wood to the villages to avoid over harvesting of trees. Bilevel
                optimisation is applied to support the leaders in allocating wood fairly. Bilevel optimisation
                models the competing objectives of two parties. In this case, the committee wants to satisfy all
                villages equally, and the independent villages want to satisfy their own welfare. Although their
                goals are similar they create competition amongst the different parties. Bilevel optimisation
                removes any favourability from the allocation of wood, ensuring a more equitable division of
                supply. When there are few villages involved in the system we can solve for optimality. But if
                there are many villages, a heuristic may need to be designed to find a near optimal feasible
                allocation outcome. Equitable allocation is not enough for Malawi to reverse deforestation,
                proactive approaches to growing a more bountiful supply and behavioural changes need to be
                enacted.</p>

            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>

            <p class="text">African miombo woodlands are disappearing due to substandard forest management practices
                influenced by demanding agricultural consumption, and dependance on wood products for
                income (Mwase et al., 2006). These harmful anthropogenic practices are forming a negative
                causal loop detrimental to both biodiversity and economic income of rural dwellers. Of the
                forested areas, customary woodlands (lands owned by indigenous people) are the most
                indisposed and devoid of forest management techniques. Rural Malawians primarily depend on
                customary lands and forest reserves for subsistence agriculture and wood products to support
                their livelihoods at the expense of the forests. In 2019, Malawi had a population of 18.6 million,
                by 2038 the World Bank expects the population to double. Heightened demand is clearing out
                customary lands, and people are desperately turning to forest reserves as their main source of
                supply, also threatening it. With rapid population growth, Malawi's problems are expected to
                worsen (World Bank, 2020).</p>
            <p class="text">Rural dwellers rely on forest products to support their own needs as well as to provide economic
                welfare by converting wood into fuel (firewood and charcoal) and cutting timber for
                construction, both of which they then sell to urban residents (Campbell, pg 2, World Bank,
                2020). Income from forest products makes up approximately 15% of the average rural
                household's total income, preventing poverty and improving quality of life (Kamanga et al.,
                2009, Fisher 2004). Moreover, households whose incomes depend on forest resources the most
                are those that have little coming in from other sources, because there are not many other options
                for income (Chilongo, 2014, World Bank, 2020). The competing needs of food, income and fuel
                create a complicated and unsustainable relationship with the forest- subsistence farming negates
                the potential for economic welfare and vice versa.</p>
            <p class="text">Approximately 89% of all Malawian households do not have electricity, and 97% rely on some
                form of wood fuel to meet their energy related needs for cooking and heating. With charcoal and
                firewood being the most popular forms of wood fuel. Although the government is attempting to
                transition citizens to using other forms of fuel approximately 54% of urban households still rely
                on charcoal, because it is the cheapest option and they cannot afford other sources (Reytar,
                2017). The second most popular wood product is timber. International demand for hardwoods
                have been profitable for Malawians who have few income alternatives.</p>
            <p class="text">Villagers initially harvested wood to support subsistence living, but now do so illegally and
                unsustainably for retail (Africa Geographic, 2019). It is predicted that demand for wood products
                will surpass supply by 2030, creating a shortage that will drive up prices for firewood and
                charcoal, leading to increased economic hardship for poorer urban residence who are unable to
                afford the elevated prices (Ministry of Natural Resources, 2017, pg 6). Through the international
                markets for forest products there has been increased economic activity, and Malawi has seen year
                over year growth within recent years but it is still one of the poorest countries in the world
                (World Bank, 2020).</p>

            
            <h3 class="sect1">1.1 Deforestation</h3>

            <p class="text">According to the FOA (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) (2020) global
                deforestation peaked in the 1990s when approximately 16 million hectares of forestry was lost
                each year (Houghton, pg 313, 2016). At the turn of the century this rate tapered and by 2015 to
                2020 it was estimated at 10 million hectares per year, falling 37.5% from the previous decade.
                Currently, the FOA (2020) estimates global forestry covers 4.06 billion hectares, implying a
                0.25% loss rate this year with expected year over year growth. The size of Malawi's total
                forested areas is currently unknown as forest management data has not been collected in almost
                two decades. The last reliable estimate was in 2001, at 2.6 million hectares of forests, covering
                27.6% of the nation. Deforestation rates are estimated between 1-3%, occurring at 33,000
                hectares a year- at least four times higher than the global rate (FOA, 2016, Ngwira & Watanabe,
                2019).</p>
            <p class="text">Deforestation is known to negatively affect animal habitat, climate, and quality of soil to name a
                few. Global climate is impacted by deforestation when carbon stored within plants are released
                and earth's surface is physically altered. Deforestations warms the atmosphere by 1) adding the
                carbon stored in trees into the atmosphere 2) lowering the quantity of water in the
                evapotranspiration process, and 3) decreasing the overall amount of trees which can store carbon
                (Bala et al, 2007). Hajabbasi et al (1997) found that deforestation was harmful to soil, lowering
                its overall quality. Their research concluded that soil in deforested lands (compared to virgin
                forests) were 20% more compact, had 50% less nitrogen, and organic matter and soluble ions
                dropped by 10 to 15%. Research has also been done to understand the affects on large mammals'
                habitat. Kinnaird et al (2003) state many large animals prefer to remain a buffer of 2 to 3
                kilometres away from forest edges. Therefore as forests continue to shrink so do habitats.</p>

            <h3 class="sect1">1.2 Problem</h3>

            <p class="text">We demonstrate the use of bilevel optimisation for forest management, which to our knowledge
                has not yet been used. Although many strides have been made within the field, most research is
                focused on a single harvester and do not consider the competition of wood resources. From our
                research completed it has become clear that operational research methods have not been a
                predominant tool for battling deforesting in Africa. Malawi's deforestation crisis is both an
                environmental and socioeconomic issue affecting the livelihood of many citizens, placing
                urgency on this research. The proposed bilevel model is intended to support Malawi's
                government and community leaders in allocating wood for harvesting to villagers who may use
                wood products for personal use and/or for income.</p>
            <p class="text">The committee, consisting of community leaders, must consider the wood demands of each
                village and the distance they must travel to retrieve it. Each village is an independent actor, and
                may choose to do what is economically best for them rather than what is best for the
                environment. Their decisions will then affect the decisions of any other villages who choose to
                act after them. Wood cut from areas allocated to the village is considered legal, wood cut from
                any other area is considered illegal. Each village has its own objective function measuring
                economic welfare that it wants to maximise, and the committee's objective is a summation of all
                the villages less a penalty for wood allocated beyond minimum demand.</p>
            <p class="text">The allocation of wood to multiple villagers who are competing for resources resembles a
                Stackelberg-Nash game. The models seeks to emulate the behaviours of all participants:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="text"><span class="ital">Leader's allocation of wood for harvest</span> - community 
                        leaders allocate wood with the intent of meeting villagers' demands, and discouraging any 
                        illegal harvesting. All supply can be allocated to further help avoid illegal harvesting, 
                        but that would defeat the purpose of protecting the forests from deforestation, so we penalise 
                        the leader for allocating wood beyond minimum demand with the intent of understanding the changes
                        of allocation behaviour depending on the penalty.</li>
                    <li class="text"><span class="ital">Villagers' behaviours depending on fine for illegal harvesting 
                        and travel costs</span> - each village wants to maximise their own welfare, but we would like 
                        to understand when the cost-benefit is worth it. Are travel costs worth the additional wood? Is 
                        risking paying a fine worth cutting wood illegally?</li>
                    <li class="text"><span class="ital">Influence of altruism on villages</span> - Not all decision-making 
                        is financially influenced. We want to figure out how altruism towards other villages and caring 
                        about conserving the environment will influence villagers' decision-making.</li>
                </ol>
            <p class="text underimage">Although it is the responsibility of both the government and citizens to protect the forests,
                transitioning to a sustainable forest management program can appear exclusively beneficial in
                the long term triggering adverse behaviours in citizens who are suffering financially. This issue is
                not unique to Malawi, but also to many other countries within Africa, such as Central Africa
                Republic, Zambia, and Democratic Republic of Congo to name a few (World Wildlife Fund).
                According to the World Economic Forum there are 60 million+ hectares of tropical forests on
                continental Africa, accounting for approximately 15-18% of the world's tropical forests with the
                second largest forest in the world being the Congo Basin. This model, 'Bilevel Optimisation for
                Equitable Wood Harvesting' is generalised, so it may be adapted to individual areas so that it is
                helpful to other areas and not just those villages in our case study- east of the Namizimu Forest
                Reserve.</p>
            <p class="text">Notable novelties of this work are:</p>

        <section class="subsection two">

            <h3>2. Background</h3>

            <p class="text">In Malawi, there are catastrophic secondary effects for the climate such as dwindling water
                supply (Ministry of Natural Resources,2017, pg 1). If Malawians continue along this trajectory
                of abusing their natural forests they are projected to be wiped from existence by 2079. The crisis
                has required the Government of Malawi (GoM) to use unconventional approaches to curb illegal
                logging. In 2016, army forces were stationed at the Dzalanyama Forest Reserve to defend the 
                trees and prevent further deforestation (Africa Geographic, 2019). Simultaneously the GoM
                began developing the National Charcoal Strategy to not only reverse deforestation but to create
                sustainable and economically beneficial logging habits for its citizens (Ministry of Natural
                Resources,2017, pg 7).</p>
            <p class="text">For many decades the GoM has been struggling with deforestation, and the National Charcoal
                Strategy is not their first attempt at fixing it, but an iteration of past policies. In 1997, the GoM
                implemented the Forest Act to establish a sustainable process for charcoal- to legally produce
                charcoal the individual or company must receive a government licence and follow the guidelines
                within the forest management plan. Though well intentioned, their guidelines were not sufficient
                and the policy led to the banning of charcoal production in 1997, furthering forest
                mismanagement, illegal harvesting, and loss of revenue for the country because there were not
                identifiable or affordable charcoal alternatives for citizens (Forest Act 1997, 1997). Illegal
                charcoal production continued to grow. It was evident that trees collected were from forest
                reserves and that if new policies were not enacted this behaviour would continue unchanged
                (Zulu, 2010). In 2016, the National Forest Policy focused its efforts to "achieve sustainable selfsufficiency
                of firewood, charcoal and forest product and services" (Malawi Government, 2016).
                The policy's approach was less top down, and aimed to empower citizens to be a part of the
                change towards sustainable charcoal production and forest management. Moreover, it included
                promoting alternative cooking energy sources, and bettered law enforcement to reduce illegal
                harvesting. While these efforts created cultural improvements, the increased national demand for
                wood products has negated many past efforts.</p>


            <h3 class="sect1">2.1 Co-Management</h3>

            <p class="text">In the National Charcoal Strategy 2017-2027 the Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and
                Mining outlined seven inter-related pillars to undertake the issues of shrinking forests and rising
                demands for household fuel. This Masters dissertation aligns with Pillar 4: Strengthen Law
                Enforcement, "The objective of this pillar is to enhance enforcement of existing laws and
                regulations in order to reduce illegal wood harvesting and charcoal production and to create a
                market for sustainable wood and charcoal production," (Ministry of Mines, 2017).</p>
            <p class="text">In previous years, villages were permitted to cut trees from land specifically allotted to them by
                the government. Trees cut from anywhere else were considered to be cut illegally. If caught,
                villagers were expected to pay a fine determined by how much was cut. This centralised
                approach did not work well as it was difficult to monitor the forests due to the limitations of the
                government, and the long journey to the city meant no one went to pay the fine nor held
                accountable. The Government of Malawi adjusted their approach by introducing co-management
                policies(GoM, 1997). This concept transfers the governing responsibility from the government to
                committees; each committee is responsible for a subset of villages, a specified forest area and is
                managed by villagers belonging to those villages.</p>
            <p class="text">Jumbe and Angelsen (2007) researched the effectiveness of community-based management, and
                deduced households were more likely to participate in conservation efforts if they are highly
                dependent on the forest. Although, if households cannot afford the fee to participate they will not
                and will therefore harvest illegally. Separately, villagers are obedient to their tribe's chief, if
                many villagers belong to the main tribe, and the chief supports forest conservation it is more
                likely that the villagers will too.</p>

            <h3 class="sect1">2.2 Case Study: Namizimu Forest Reserve</h3>

            <p class="text">Namizimu translates to 'the place of the spirits.' The Namizimu forest reserve is located in the
                Mangochi district of Malawi's southern region, straddling Mozambique on its north-east boarder
                and Lake Malawi on its western boarder (Figure 1). It is a mountainous region with an altitude
                ranging from five hundred to eighteen hundred meters, spanning 82,831 hectares. The forest
                reserve still remains largely untouched, but is beginning to feel the burden of human activity
                such as harvesting of wood for charcoal and timber to satiate urban civilisation's demand
                (Dreoni, 2020). The GoM has not initiated co-management policies in this region yet, but plans
                to introduce it when they begin the Shire River Basin Management Program (GoM, 2013). As
                co-management has not yet been implemented here, there is an opportunity to use optimisation
                techniques to distribute wood equitably.</p>
            <p class="text abovegraph">The villages east of Namizimu forest reserve are the main focus; villages west of the reserve are
                also close to Lake Malawi. These west side villages depend on fish products for their main 
                source of income and are therefore not as reliant or susceptible to the forest. Of the villages on
                the eastern sides, there are 110 within a five kilometre buffer of Namizimu Forest for whom comanagement
                policies will be implemented (Dreoni, 2020).</p>

            <h3>3. Literature Review</h3>

            <p class="text">Forest management optimisation models have evolved over the last 50 to 60 years where new
                techniques have emerged to utilise complicated non-linear relationships (Kaya et al., 2016). The
                field of forest management has arisen to meet ever growing human demand of forest products in
                a way that is less harmful towards the environment. Turner et al. (2002) acknowledge that
                environmental models contain unpredictable interactions between many elements making it
                difficult to model sustainability. To achieve modelling in the past, environmental problems were
                segmented into components of multiple simpler solvable models and then integrated with one
                another. But, with improved computing abilities and modern optimisation methods it has been
                possible to solve forest management problems with fewer but more intricate models.</p>
            <p class="text">Long-term sustainability is a challenge for forest management problems as there are frequently
                opposing objectives (Maser, 1994). Turner et al. (2002) use goal programming to find a strategy
                that satiates the competing objectives of the State Forests of New South Wales who are
                responsible for maintaining water, soil and biodiversity while fulfilling sawlog and pulpwood
                demands of local companies. A single level model was formulated to solve for the competing
                objectives, because although competing there was a sole decision-maker, which allowed for a
                single objective function to represent all decision variables. Data was not available for the
                intended 43 year planning horizon, and so final results are dependable for only the first 20 years.
                Results showed steady sawlog and pulpwood production could be achieved while upholding
                environmental responsibilities.</p>
            <p class="text">Bertomeu and Romero (2002) formulate and analyse the trade-off between tree biodiversity (age
                and species) and financial gain. Using a zero-one goal programming model they previously built,
                Bertomeu and Romero (2001) look to better understand and maintain the biodiversity forest
                stands (the quantity of trees in a woodland area). Their 2002 iteration develops the preceding
                harvest timetable's parametric constraints and gives insight into the opportunity cost for varying
                quantities of trees felled during harvest schedules. This model's graphs' visually capture the
                conflict between pay-offs clearly where other models have not.</p>
            <p class="text">Korhonen (1998) explores the application of Multiple Objective Linear Programming (MOLP) to
                forest management. In Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) there are usually numerous
                criterium that must be satisfied to some degree to produce a set of options a decision-maker can
                select one from. Public forests supply communities with many products and services, and in this
                case study forrest management must decide how much of each should be supplied. Individual
                equations were written for each of management's eight goals and for the seven available forest
                resources effectively intertwining their relationships. Using a previously designed method by
                Korhonen and Wallenius (1998) called Pareto Race, which gives the decision-maker the ability to
                search along the boundary in their choice of direction and speed the MOLP was solved.</p>
            <p class="text">Saaty (1990) goes into detail about how to make a decision when multiple criteria needs to be
                considered. He developed the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to order factors in a top-down
                hierarchal format, layering objective, sub-criteria, and alternatives in descending order. Pair-wise
                comparisons are used to approximate the values of factors based on criteria until an outcome is
                established. Kuusipalo and Kangas (1994) apply AHP to a forest management problem,
                prioritising biodiversity and not just maximising economic output. Biological diversity is
                incorporated into the hierarchy's objective level and further elaborated and represented in the
                sub-criteria. The management strategies for whom revenue is of importance is placed in the
                hierarchy's lowest level. The strategy which best preserved biodiversity and brought in an
                acceptable profit was selected.</p>
            <p class="text">In recent years it has become popular to include carbon in the objective functions of forest
                management optimisation problems (Keles, 2010). Keles (2010) constructs three separate linear
                models for maximising the net present value of 1) harvested timber 2) carbon debt and 3) total
                carbon debt and timber produced. A simulation of the tree stands harvesting schedule is included.
                The combination of techniques concluded a 10.5% increase in net present value if the trees are
                cut no earlier than ten years of age.</p>
            <p class="text">Several authors have combined operational research techniques with economic utility functions
                to make better multi-criteria decisions. Utility functions quantify the satisfaction of consumer
                preferences by evaluating the utility gained from the consumption of goods (Chakrabati & Roy,
                2010). Varma et al. (2000) built an aspiration-based utility function within a model using linear
                programming and geographic information systems (GIS). Using Mykkanen's (1994) approach
                for incorporating aspiration levels into utility functions the decision-makers preferences are
                demonstrated in the aspiration levels. Maximising the utility implicitly embodies the multicriteria
                partiality in attaining sustainability of temporal and spatial dimensions in forest
                management to propose strategies for the efficient use forest land. As the model seeks to address
                both current and future needs, it was pointed out that aspirations need to change as the times do.</p>
            <p class="text">F&#252;rstenau et al. (2006) use multi-criteria analysis (MCA) to asses multiple purposes and
                stakeholders of an additive utility function for forest management alternatives. The various
                stakeholders are interested in the partial objectives- biodiversity, replenishing of ground water,
                quantity of timber and carbon sequestration which are prioritised using AHP. To understand how 
                the climate and 6 forest management strategies will affect the forest over 100 years model 4C
                (Forest Ecosystems in a Changing Environment) is used. Model 4C simulates tree stands and the
                effects of 1) climate change on biodiversity, environment and forest growth, 2) ecological
                changes and 3) forest management strategies on the ecosystem (Lasch-Born et al., 2019). Utility
                for the six strategies were shaped by the priority of the partial objectives, i.e. strategies
                containing higher ranked partial objectives had higher utility.</p>
            <p class="text">Unlike the previously mentioned studies, K&#246;hlin and Parks (2001) fight deforestation at a
                household level. Though many focus on forest management through companies and the
                government, deforestation is also highly impacted by the daily decision-making of millions of
                households relying on the forests for forest products (K&#246;hlin and Parks, 2001). In India, one of
                the most successful strategies for decreasing deforestation was through implementing village
                woodlots for household fuel. A household utility function describes the collection behaviour of
                households who can choose between collecting fuel form natural forests, village woodlots and/or
                the market. The model is implicitly designed to maximise utility of decisions made by
                households. The method of Lagrange multipliers is used to find the optimum amounts of fuel
                wood collected at woodlots or natural forests and several other parameters. Results revealed
                decreased fuelwood harvesting in natural forests depends on the position of the village woodlot
                relative to the village and forest. The outcome is a non-linear upside-down 'U' that climaxes
                when village woodlots are approximately 3 kilometres from natural forests, indicating household
                decision making is most volatile here in respect to shadow wage.</p>
            <p class="text">Competing objectives or criteria may not always be beholden to a single decision-maker. Within
                Yeu and You's (2017) model decision-making is decentralised amongst two members of a
                biofuels and forestry supply chain- a harvesting company supplies forest products to a pulp
                company. The differences in their decision-making power can be deemed non-cooperative
                thereby aligning with a Stackelberg leader-follower game (von Stackelberg, 2011). Bard (1998)
                states bilevel programming problems (BLPP) can be viewed as a fixed form of von Stackelberg's
                leader-follower game. A follower's problem is generally limited to linear or quadratic
                programming; if binary parameters are included it creates a barrier to transforming the bilevel
                problem into a single level problem using Karusch-Kuhn- Tucker (KKT) conditions (Yeu and
                You, 2017). To overcome this obstruction Yeu and You (2017) use a reformulation-and-
                decomposition algorithm in place of KKT so they may include discrete variables for the follower
                in their mixed-integer bilevel problem. Both participants' objectives are to maximise their annual
                profit (annual revenue- total costs), by doing so the followers' decisions influence the leader's
                profit and decision space. The solutions showed that all members in the supply chain can earn up
                to 10% of revenue.</p>
            <p class="text">Although Yeu and You (2014) explore bilevel optimisation in relation to supply chain, a
                secondary market of forest management, the model addresses similar multi-criteria decisionmaking
                as equitable wood harvesting. The participants within this supply chain are a single
                leader and multiple followers, a Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium game. Stackelberg-Nash
                equilibrium game expands on Sackelberg game; the Nash equilibrium game simultaneously
                anticipates the outcome of decision strategies for several decision-makers where they all affect
                one another (Osborne and Rubinstien, 1994). Although there seems to be three levels of
                participants: suppliers, manufacturer and customers, suppliers and customers are group together
                as followers. The manufacturer (leader) which sits in the middle of the supply chain structure
                optimises for its own decision variables using a non-convex mixed integer nonlinear problem
                while the both lower-level customers and suppliers maximise their profits through optimising
                their activity in linear problems. A singular level was achieved through KKT reformulation,
                substituting the lower-level objective functions with KKT conditions. Global optimisation i.e.
                total profit for all participants was solved for using a branch-and-refine algorithm, with 80% of it
                belonging to the leader.</p>

            <h3 class="sect1">3.1 Social Games and Altruism</h3>
            <p class="text">Batson (1943) describes altruism as "a desire to benefit someone else for his or her sake rather
                than one's own." Fehr and Schmidt (2005) state a person is altruistic if their utility raises in
                response to others' good fortune, or if \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\) is strictly positive 
                for <span class="ital">u(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>,..., x<sub>N</sub>)</span>. Decision-makers
                within social games do not solely care about what is allocated to them, but also what is
                designated to others. This is unlike classical utility theories which state decision-makers seek to
                appease their own rational or conditions (Fehr & Schmidt, 2005). The decision-making process
                of followers within equitable wood harvesting encompasses their relative understanding of why
                their supply is limited to protect the environment and to ensure other villages have their needs
                met. This social responsibility can be measured using social games and altruistic utility
                functions. Even though every village may be aware of why their supply is limited it may not
                prevent them from acting selfishly; economic theories of Other-Regarding Preferences are utility
                functions that may explain the behaviours of the villagers. There are three subgroups of this
                theorem:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li class="text"><span class="bold">Social Preferences</span> - players care about what the other 
                        players in the game are allocated.</li>
                    <li class="text"><span class="bold">Interdependent Preferences</span> - players care about how altruistic or selfish other players are,
                        and their preferences will sway to one the other depending on the other play.</li>
                    <li class="text"><span class="bold">Intention based Reciprocity</span> - a player's preference will depend on what he thinks the other
                        players' intentions are (Fehr & Schmidt, 2005).</li>
                </ol>

            <p class="text">Models categorised as social preference and interdependent preferences are explored. In some
                cases, players care more about their outcome relative to that of others more than they do about
                the amount itself, this is classified as relative income and envy (Bolton, 1991), a social
                preference. The model contains variables for how much is allocated to each player and their
                perceived value of their payouts during a specific period. Because \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \leq 0\)
                it is the antithesis of altruism, it does not encompass unselfish behaviour (Bolton 1991).</p>
            <p class="text">Player <span class="ital">i</span> internally predetermine what quantity is an acceptable amount; if other players earn
                above that set amount player <span class="ital">i</span> will feel resentment towards them, but if they earn below it player
                <span class="ital">i</span>  will feel altruism (Fehr and Schmidt, 1999). Player <span class="ital">i</span> has inequity aversion. Each player has a
                parameter representing their dislike for unfavourable inequality; player <span class="ital">i</span> is indifferent if they
                receive equal or more than player <span class="ital">j</span>, but will be dissatisfied if allocated less. This utility function
                requires heterogeneousness from players, and is able to justify the positivity and negativity of
                players towards others (Fehr and Schidt, 1999).</p>
            <p class="text">Quasi-maximin preferences blend Rawls' inequity aversion function, "disinterested social
                welfare function" with the sum of players' payoff to create a convex utility function, with the
                latter part representing altruism established on a concept of all players' payoffs are weighted
                equally. The utility function of each player is calculated through a mixture of the individual's
                payoff and the aforementioned function. Players are concerned about the welfare of others, but
                not as much if another player is more prosperous (Charness and Rabin, 2002).</p>
            <p class="text">One of the interdependent preferences utility functions is Levine (1998) altruism and spitefulness
                model. Each player is given a parameter ranging between selfishness to indifference to altruistic,
                and another for how much they care about the outlook of other players. Each player's goal is to
                maximise their utility either through their own success, that of others, or some combination of
                both. A downside to this model is that it cannot describe why a player may be spiteful in one
                instance but altruistic in another.</p>

        <h3>4. Methodology</h3>

            <p class="text">Within Bilevel Optimisation there are two categories of competing decision-makers motived by
                self-interest. Each is represented by a level, level 1 or the upper level is modelled for the leader,
                and level 2 or the lower level is modelled for the followers which gives the decision making
                structure its bilevel. The followers constraints and objectives are a part of the leader's
                constraints, although the leader is influenced by the followers constraints the followers are not
                affected by the leader's. The equilibrium outcome from the lower level simultaneously
                influencing the performance of the objective function of the upper level ie the decisions of the
                lower level must be considered by the upper level if an optimal solution is to be found (Bard,
                1998, Colson et al, 2007, Zeng & An, 2014).</p>
            <p class="text">Two strategic economic games are represented within this bilevel problem (BLP): Stackelberg
                competition and Nash equilibrium. The structure of the bilevel model captures the sequential
                decision making order of Stackelberg competition's leader first, follower after design. The
                original Stackelberg game had two players. The leader makes the first decision, which it cannot
                undo; and the leader is aware that the follower will be monitoring its actions. The leader is also
                privy to the decisions the follower will make in response. Whichever of the two players gains its
                position as the leader does so because they were already in an advantageous position. Although
                the leader has the advantage they must not abuse their power, because the follower has the option
                to refuse participation which will make the leaders plan infeasible (Dempe, 2002, Dempe et al,
                2015).</p>
            <p class="text">If there is more than one follower, it can further be solved to find the Nash equilibrium amongst
                said followers. Nash equilibrium is a non-cooperative game consisting of 2 or more players, each
                player selfishly makes whichever decision they deem best for themselves, while knowing what
                was already decided for them by the leader (Osborne & Rubenstein, 1994). Each player's
                strategy will depend on events that have already occurred in the game. Therefore their strategy
                must change throughout the game in reaction to previous decisions made by opponents until their
                action is complete. The concluding cluster of strategy choices is considered a Nash equilibrium.</p>
            <p class="text underimage">A Stackelberg-Nash game can be mathematically formulated as follows (Bard, 1998, Colson et
                al, 2007):</p>

                <div class="equations ">
                    <p class="indent">\(\max \limits_ {x \in X, y} \quad F(x,y)\)</p>
                    <p class="indent">\(s.t. \quad G_i (x,y) \leq 0 , \quad i= 1,..,n \)</p>
                    <p class="indent1">\(\max\limits_y \quad f_k(x,y) \quad k=1,..l\)</p>
                    <p class="indent1">\(s.t. \quad g_j (x,y) \leq 0, \quad j=1,..m\)</p>
                </div>

            <p class="text underimage">For equitable wood harvesting, the leader is a committee formed by a group of villages, and 
                the followers are the villages. The committee's objective is to maximise welfare for the group of 
                villages, to be successful the committee must maximise the welfare of each individual village. Welfare 
                is quantified by calculating income from selling wood, cost of transportation, fine for illegally wood, 
                other income, and a measure for altruism which is assumed to influence decision making. </p>        
            <p class="text">Economic preferences and utility theory best represent welfare. Utility can be described as:
                <span class="inline_eq">\(u(x) \geq u(y) \,  \Leftrightarrow \, x \succeq y\)</span>. A player chooses between <span class="ital">x</span> 
                and <span class="ital">y</span>, if the utility of <span class="ital">x</span> is greater than the
                utility of <span class="ital">y</span> then <span class="ital">x</span> is 'weakly preferred' to 
                <span class="ital">y</span>, that is <span class="ital">y</span> will not be selected over <span class="ital">x</span> when there is a
                choice to make between the two. By observing the choices players make the utility implicitly
                translates their values (Ingersoll, 2019). For villages, this structure is captured in their decisionmaking
                about legal and illegal wood, we can understand the value of each through utility. The
                value of each unit of wood is expected to decrease as each additional unit is acquired, therefore 
                each unit is of lesser value than the previous one, the welfare function must therefore take on a
                concave shape.</p>
            <p class="text">The committee is tasked with allocating wood to villages in a manner that will satisfy their
                demands, the committee must also anticipate the villages making their own independent
                decisions. Despite having the ability to autonomously make decisions, each village may be
                influenced by the committee to some degree. They must decide if harvesting wood from
                elsewhere is worth the fine charged for illegal behaviour. This BLP consists of N villages, and 1
                leader, therefore the model is solving for N+1 non-linear programming models simultaneously,
                capturing the intertwining relationship amongst the N+1 parties.</p>

            <h3 class="sect1">4.1 Altruism and Decision Making</h3>

            <p class="text">It is assumed within a Nash equilibrium game all players are selfish therefore caring about only
                their own financial outcomes (Levine, 1998). But, economist such as Kenneth Arrow (1981) and
                Amartya Sen (1995) have alluded that not all people solely care for themselves, they also care
                about how their decision-making will affect others. Other economist expressed that people care
                mostly about fairness and for mutuality in social interactions (Fehr & Schmidt, 2005).</p>
            <p class="text">It was crucial to include an element of altruism in equitable wood harvesting. When interviewed,
                villagers in Malawi expressed that they understood the need for co-management schemes to
                protect the environment and to ensure that everyone gets their fair share of the supply (Dreoni,
                2020). It also matters because if a single village chooses to maximise their own utility function it
                may grossly harm the other villages thereby leading to an overall low objective outcome for the
                leader. 'Theories of Other-Regarding Preferences' were previously explored in the Literature
                Review, concluding Levine's (1998) model for 'Altruism and Spitefulness': 
                <span class="inline_eq">\(U_i = x_i +\sum_{j\neq i} x_j (\alpha_i + \lambda\alpha_j)/(1+\lambda)\)</span> to be later adapted, was best suited 
                to exemplify the relationship between villages.</p>
            <p class="text">Each village's utility function outcome is an average altruism score of their interrelationships
                with all the other villages in the game. Using \(\lambda\) we can quantify how much a village cares about 
                the others opinions of altruism, though it may be counter intuitive, if a village is altruistic
                towards one that is spiteful <span class="inline_eq">(\(-\lambda\alpha_j > \alpha_i \))</span> village <span class="ital">i</span> will act 
                more spitefully towards itself. If the utility function will shorten to <span class="inline_eq">\(U_i = x_i +\alpha_i\sum_{j\neq i}x_j\)</span>, 
                this makes it possible (but not strictly) for <span class="ital">i</span> to have a higher utility score than if 
                both <span class="ital">i</span> and <span class="ital">j</span> were included 
                (<span class="inline_eq">\(\lambda > 0\)</span> and <span class="inline_eq">\(\alpha_{i'} &le; 0\)</span>). 
                Adding in this component to each village's objective function somewhat forces them to consider others as
                being too selfish will negatively impact their objective function.</p>

                <p class="text">Bilevel optimisation models are non-convex and non-differentiable. Jeroslow (1985) and Hensen
                    et al (1992) independently demonstrated that bilevel problems are NP-hard even when in the
                    simplest form of both upper and lower problems being linear (Colson et al., 2007). To solve
                    BLPs the two levels can be reformulated into one level with complementarity constraints by
                    using Karush- Kuhn- Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions, producing a computationally feasible
                    problem. For KKT to be used, the lower level problems' objective function must be twice
                    differentiable and not contain any discrete variables (Dempe, 2002).</p>
                <p class="text">KKT is derived from the method of Lagrangian multipliers which exclusively uses only equality
                    constraints. For all villages we remove their individual optimisation models and replace them
                    with their optimality conditions, each of the conditions will gain a unique Lagrangian multiplier
                    for every village. These conditions will be treated as constraints for the BLP. KKT's theorem
                    states, if a saddle point is found for Lagrangian function an optimal solution vector exists for the
                    system. Although the Lagrangian function itself is not used, its first order differentials for 
                    <span class="ital">x</span> and <span class="ital">y</span>
                    (lower level's decision variables) are used to establish stationarity which is an essential condition
                    to solving KKT (Dempe, 2002).</p>
                <p class="text">For KKT to be solvable there are necessary conditions that must be satisfied 1) stationarity for
                    the decision variables, 2) primal feasibility, 3) dual feasibility and 4) complementary slackness.
                    If the conditions are fulfilled all optimal solutions will be among the KKT points, and it is
                    possible to have more KKT points than optimal solutions, at minimum there will be sufficiency all
                    KKT points will be a part of the optimal solution. Complimentary slackness is the product of
                    a Lagrangian multiplier and lower level constraint all brought to the left hand side (slack) equal
                    to 0; they are orthogonal meaning that one of them must be 0. The 'slack' equations are included
                    in the Lagrangian function (to be differentiated for stationarity), if the slack is negative or zero it
                    is feasible, if it is strictly positive it becomes a penalty. Furthermore, regularity conditions or
                    constraint qualifications need to be satisfied for KKT to be used. For the BLP of equitable wood
                    harvesting, all constraints are linear affine functions, so no additional conditions need to be
                    satisfied (Dempe, 2002).</p>
                <p class="text">Once all conditions are met a global saddle point may be found in the cone of feasibility. The
                    saddle point is the point where all the gradients for <span class="ital">x</span> (and <span class="ital">y</span>) 
                    orthogonally intersect and are equal to 0 thereby meeting the constraint 
                    <span class="inline_eq">\(\frac {\partial L} {\partial x} = 0\)</span> 
                    (<span class="inline_eq">\(\frac {\partial L} {\partial y} = 0\)</span>). If there is necessity (ie more KKT points than
                    optimal solutions) each solution to this system of inequalities will become an optimum solution
                    for each village and a solution to that system (Dempe, 2002).</p>
                <p class="text">Additionally, even if all conditions are satisfied bilevel problems are still difficult to solve 
                    in nature. This is because the Lagrangian and complementarity constraints contain non-convexities; and the
                    complementarity constraints are inherently combinatorial (Colson et al, 2007). The complexities are BLP 
                    rapidly increase as N increases, which each value of N increase the model must consider an additional LP 
                    model. The solution space grows much larger and the time to computational solve the problem grows exponentially 
                    (Dempe, 2002). </p>

            <h3 class="sect1">4.3 High Point Relaxation</h3>
            
            <p class="text">As mentioned above, the method of solving a BLP using KKT reformulation becomes complex
                quickly with each unit of N increase. Another approach for solving the BLP is to use high point
                relaxation, but unlike with KKT the solution does not converge towards optimality, but towards a
                feasible region. Because there are significantly less constraints and variables less computational
                time is required (Zeng & An, 2014).</p>
            <p class="text">High point relaxation solves the upper level problem and finds the optimum outcome for the
                leader; the lower level objective functions are dropped and constraints from both levels are kept.
                Though the leader's decision making is influenced by the constraints of the followers, the
                leader's decision still reflects their ideal solution, not a realistic one. It removes independent
                decision making power from the followers, and ignores that this is a non-cooperative game
                seeking an equilibrium (Zeng & An, 2014).</p>
            <p class="text">By using high point relaxation we can fix the quantities allocated to each village by the
                committee. This will provide critical insight into the decision-making strategies of the
                independent villages without any influence of the committees objective to maximise the overall
                welfare of all villages.</p>
            <p class="text">For equitable wood harvesting, the leader's decision variable is \(\overline x\), for the 
                followers they are <span class="ital">x</span> and <span class="ital">y</span>. When the committee allocates 
                wood to each village, it would undoubtedly prefer the villages strictly cut wood legally (<span class="ital">x</span>) 
                and not illegally (<span class="ital">y</span>). Therefore it is necessary to solve the
                lower level programming model to understand the selfish motives of the villages who pursue
                maximising their own welfare.</p>

            <h3 class="sect1">4.4 Assumptions</h3>

            <ol>
                <li class="text textlist">All villages within the system will take part in the community based scheme, even though we
                    already know that all villages do not take part. One of the limitations to using KKT
                    conditions to reformulate bilevel problems is that discrete variables cannot be included in the
                    lower problem, therefore we cannot use a binary variable to identify which villages are
                    interested in having wood allocated or not.</li>
                <li class="text textlist">Dreoni (2020) states fees for taking part in the scheme are relative to the quantity of demand
                    and the tree type. For this model all trees are valued the same.</li>
                <li class="text textlist">We assume that if distance to allocated supply is far a village may choose to go elsewhere
                    instead to decrease their own costs.</li>
                <li class="text textlist">All villages who cut wood illegally will pay the fine they owe. In reality, villages only pay
                    the fine when they are caught cutting illegal wood and make the effort to go pay it. It is more
                    likely that a villager may get away without paying the fine.</li>
                <li class="text textlist">Behaviour to harvest illegally will be influenced by the altruism portion of the objective
                    functions.</li>
                <li class="text textlist">Villagers must carry wood roundtrip, that is, their journey begins at their village to a single
                    supply of wood then back to the village, but if the truck is not full they could go to other
                    areas of supply before returning to the village.</li>
                <li class="text textlist">Personal demand is static. The figure used for minimum demand represents how much the
                    village uses for themselves, and then all other wood harvested beyond that is for sale. But, a
                    village can harvest more than minimum demand and not sell any of it.</li>

            <h3 class="sect1 underimage">4.6 Solving using Baron in AMPL IDE</h3>
            
            <p class="text">Finding a solution to BLP relies on branch-and-bound techniques (Zeng & An, 2014); to solve
                equitable harvesting Baron solver for AMPL is used for its spatial branch-and-bound search
                method. Spatial brand-and-bound depends on upper and lower bounds for all variables so that it
                can narrow in on the feasible region for the objective function in a timely manner (Smith &
                Pantelides, 1999). The branch-and-bound algorithm assures optimatimality, if not accomplished a
                feasible solution does not exist (Bard, 1998) . Not all variables within our model are bounded on
                both ends, so a large arbitrary parameter (bigM) is used to fulfil this need.</p>
            <p class="text">There are 110 villages east of the Namizimu Forest Reserve within 5km of the forest parameter
                (Dreoni, 2020). The villages are littered north to south along the parameter of the forest reserve;
                although the committee is represented by each village it is unlikely that one committee will
                govern the entire area as one of the main reasons for community-based system is to decentralise
                it. The bisection method is used to understand what the largest N and k parameters can be used in
                the model. For bisection we begin by using N=2 and N=110, k= N/2. A smaller k value is used to
                instigate competition, (needed for a Nash equilibrium).</p>
            <p class="text">Accurate data requires geographic information (GIS) to estimate spatial locations for supply, and
                distance. Though it is unlikely that perfect data can be estimated because of the limitations of
                using spatial location (How and Bevers, 1998). Unfortunately, the data did not become available
                on time, so pseudo-random data created in AMPL is used to demonstrate how the model works
                and perform sensitivity analysis of fine and altruism's weighted parameter as mentioned in
                the previous section.</p>

            <h3>5. Results</h3>

            <p class="text">The decision making behaviour of both the community leader and village followers were iterated
                over under the influence of a penalty for the community leader who allocated wood beyond
                minimum demand, a fine, for wood cut by villagers illegally, and the effects of altruism and
                spitefulness. The first set of tests uses the bilevel optimisation and the second uses high point
                relaxation to find \(\overline x\) and then sets it for the bilevel as a parameter to understand how the villagers
                react given allocated wood.</p>

            <h3 class="sect1">5.1 Scalability and Computation</h3>
        
            <p class="text">All computational experiments are performed on a Macbook Air with 1.1 GHz Quad-Core Intel
                Core i5 CPU and 16GB RAM. We solve the bilevel problem using AMPLE IDE- BARON. As
                previously mentioned, BARON uses an iterative branch-and-bound process to arrive at a global
                maximum or minimum. Scalability in terms of the number of lower level problems was solvable
                up to N=10, and k=5 using the entire max allowable CPU time of 500. Problems with N &geq; 11
                were infeasible due to processing constraints. When the demand and supply parameters are
                tightened, demand remains the same, and supply is lowered, so that there is still sufficient supply.
                The problem was solvable up to N=8, and k=4. The tighter the two parameters are to each other,
                the lower the number of lower level villages can be included. At minimum supply must equal
                demand to satisfy constraints. Because many combinations of parameters need to be tested the
                remaining results are using N=4, k=2 which was solved in 1.31 seconds versus N=5, k=3 in
                14.71 seconds.</p>

            <h3 class="sect1">5.2 Decision-Variables Unfixed</h3>

            <h3 class="sect2b">5.2.1 Leader's allocation of wood for harvest</h3>
            
            <p class="text abovegraph">Penalty= 0, in almost all cases, the community leaders allocated approximately 100% of the total
                supply to villages to mitigate chance of villagers harvesting illegally. In the two cases where
                allocation was lower, village <span class="ital">i</span>'s did not gain any utility from its harvest (\(\delta\)=0) or did not care
                about the opinions of others (\(\delta\) =0), and because there is no fine for illegal cutting it made no
                difference to the model. When penalty= 1, 46-48% of supply is allocated, for fine &geq; 1 and
                \(\delta\) = 1, \(\delta\) = 0, and for fine &geq; 1.25 and \(\delta\) = 1 and \(\delta\) = 0, more precisely, 46%, 48%,
                and 47% is allocated respectively. Greater quantities of wood were allocated when villages'
                utility included all aspects of the altruism score, the least amount of wood allocated occurred
                when villages showed no interest in the opinions of others (\(\delta\)=0). When penalty= fine (or is
                similar) the loss suffered by the leader is equivalent if the same quantity of wood is either illegal
                harvested or allocated. So, the committee must decide where to absorb the loss. Since we must
                maximise welfare for the individual villages as well, it is better for the leader to absorb the cost.</p>

            <h3 class="sect2">5.2.2 Villagers Behaviour to Harvest Legally or Illegally</h3>

            <p class="text">Altruism has no effect on the decision-making of villagers when penalty=0, i.e. all wood supply
                is allocated. Although there is illegal activity at \(\phi\)= 0 it is irrelevant because neither villages or
                community leaders incur a loss. It is clear that fine does have an effect, illegal behaviour
                generally peaks when there are no repercussions, but once \(\phi\)&gt; 0 all illegal harvesting subsided
                (seen in figure 3). In all cases the villages acquired all wood allocated to them before harvesting
                additional illegal wood.</p>

                as fine changes), it is much lower than the other two in its row because \(\delta\) =0, that aspect of the

            <p class="text">For penalty= 1, the objective somewhat plateaus when fine &geq; 1, because there is little illegal

                fine &lt; 1 it was beneficial for the upper level to allocate less with the expectation of illegal 
                harvesting. Welfare dramatically decreased as fine increased. Individual villages' welfares are

            <p class="text">As fine increases, so do the costs to acquire each unit of wood beyond minimum demand, and so
                even though illegal harvesting decreases with the increase of fine, overall welfare decreases. For
                all three combinations of altruism, minimum welfare= ~ -48 to -50 occurs at fine= 16. All
                villages are illegally harvesting at this time, with the average percentage of their harvest being
                done illegally at 14.6% with standard deviation= 9.9%. Villages 1, 2 and 4's illegal harvesting
                gradually lessens after this. Welfare is lowest when \(\delta\) = 0 (green line), compared to \(\delta\) &gt; 0.
                Ultimately, negative welfare means villages are not happy about the overall outcome nor or they
                financially compensated, and are taking a loss by taking part in the community based system.</p>

            <h3>6. Discussion</h3>

            <p class="text">Because all data used in the experiment is random there are no definitive results or outcomes
                from these tests, only a better understanding of if the model can aide in the allocation of wood
                for rural Malawians. Using bilevel optimisation and KKT reformulation allowed us to observe the
                decisions of both committee and villages as they simultaneously reacted to parameters. While
                high point relaxation focuses on the committee's objective and is used to implement the
                committee's allocation of wood as an unchanging parameter in the bilevel model to provide
                insight into the villages' behaviour post wood allocation. The model, as is, did not emulate the
                expected behaviours of the villagers or committee well, and maximising welfare created an
                unrealistic controlled environment.</p>
            <p class="text">The community leaders' intention of impeding illegal harvesting was successful when the entire
                supply was allocated (penalty= 0) , all villages received higher than their demands and there was
                a fine present. Penalising the community leaders produced a tradeoff effect with fine;
                maximising welfare meant that one of the two parties would have to absorb the costs for
                harvesting beyond the demand minimum. If fine &lt; penalty the community leaders allocated less
                increasing the likelihood that villages would illegally harvest thereby becoming accountable for
                the fine. If fine &gt; penalty the community leaders allocated more to villages because they know
                meeting minimum demand is not sufficient for villages to make any profit and it costs the
                objective function less if the community leaders paid the penalty. Although more wood is
                allocated, the committee never allocates in excess of 47.5% of supply meaning that penalising
                the leaders is useful for barring total supply from being allocated. Since the penalty's influence is
                not stand-alone it does not matter what the value of the constant is, what matters is its relation to
                fine.</p>
            <p class="text">Evidently, penalising the leaders was not the best approach to avoiding the allocation of all
                wood. The simultaneous decision-making of the model for all decision variables is a property of
                bilevel optimisation, and so the trade-off effect is unavoidable with both fine and penalty present.
                To eliminate this effect, one of the parameters must be removed. Fine is instrumental to the
                allocation problem, and so if bilevel optimisation is to be used the quantity of supply used in the
                model should all be permitted for allocation without penalty.</p>
            <p class="text">Parameters delta and lambda in the altruism portion of the objective function had little effect on
                the community leaders. Their influence was visible when fine = penalty \(\pm\)0.25 and penalty > 0.
                For \(\delta\) = 1, \(\lambda\) = 0 the utility of each village is impacted by the outcome of others less, therefore
                their utility is higher when they focus more on themselves. In this case, the community leaders
                increase wood allocation at fine= 0.75, because fine &lt; penalty selfish villages are more likely to
                take financial risks earlier on. When \(\delta\) = 0, \(\lambda\) = 1 villages are more altruistic because they care
                both about others and others' opinions therefore community leaders are less concerned about
                illegal harvesting and can risk increasing supply later on at fine= 1. Lastly, when \(\delta\) = 1, \(\lambda\) = 1
                the utility for all villages are highest when they themselves and all other villages prosper.
                Whereas the previous two jumped from total allocation= 24.72% to 47.54% in one fine
                increment (0.25) this one increases gradually over two increments. As there is no polarised
                preference in the altruism score portion there is less pressure on the community leaders in
                comparison to when one of the parameters is 0. Each village's \(\alpha_i\) value gives the community
                leaders insight into the villages' harvesting behaviour and their outlook on others and the
                environment. Villages 1, 3, and 4 all have \(\alpha_i\) &gt; 0 (are altruistic) and were allocated minimum
                demand by the community leaders. Whereas, village 2's \(\alpha_i\) &lt; 0 indicates spitefulness, and are
                therefore more likely to harvest illegally; the community leaders allocated village 2 3.25 times
                their minimum demand. Village 2's spitefulness means that its utility does not benefit when
                others prosper, it actually suffers, and to counteract that village 2 needs to harvest more to
                potentially receive a positive altruism score, and this is why the community leaders allocate more
                to village 2, to offset that.</p>
            <p class="text">The aforementioned trade-off effect between penalty and fine also altered the villages'
                behaviours. When there was no penalty, and all wood was allocated the villages did not harvest
                illegally, and they all harvested their max legal units of wood. When penalty= 0 and fine= 0,
                depending on how much was allocated to them they may choose to harvest all or some, and some
                chose to harvest illegally. Although the behaviours of villages' with these two constants are
                irrelevant because their behaviours are not curbed in any way.</p>
            <p class="text">With the exception of village 2 all villages harvest the max amount allocated to them by the
                committee leaders when penalty= 1 and fine &leq; penalty, and then harvest the remainder illegally,
                continuously decreasing the illegal amount as fine increases. For village 2, as fine increased they
                harvested more illegally until committee leaders increased their allocation. When almost all the
                importance is placed on village 2 (\(\delta\) = 1, \(\lambda\) = 0) it cares most about increasing its utility by
                harvesting more when the fine is lower, grabbing the second largest share of total supply, because
                its utility does not benefit from the boost of \(\lambda\) &gt; 1. In the other 2 cases where \(\lambda\)= 1, village 2
                benefits when the other villages harvest more therefore it does not need to harvest as much early
                on. But as fine increases the other villages harvest less and village 2 chooses to increase its utility
                by increasing its amount of harvested wood even though it comes at a penalty.</p>
            <p class="text">Shifting \(\overline x\) from a variable into a parameter allowed us to better focus on the decision-making of
                villages. We thought this was pertinent to our research as it is unlikely that committee leaders
                would adjust their allocation to alleviate the cost burden from villages. To obtain \(\overline x\)'s values the
                model was run using high point relaxation with penalty=fine. As we know, penalty=fine
                produces the most variability in allocation because both parties are penalised equally and so
                neither is given favourability. The results were villages 1 and 2 were allocated minimum demand,
                5 and 3 units of wood respectfully; and villages 3 and 4 were respectfully allocated 1.07 and 1.3
                times their demand.</p>
            <p class="text">For all villages with \(\alpha_i\) &gt; 0 there is a range of lower fine values where they choose not to illegally
                harvest, usually around 1.25 to 2 (and sometimes up to fine=4). The range in which villages are
                more cautious to not harvest illegally is widest when \(\delta\) = 1, \(\lambda\) = 0, that is when their utility is
                greatly affected by their own behaviour and not so much by others. Conversely it is most narrow
                when \(\delta\) = 0, \(\lambda\) = 1 and their own behaviour has less influence on their utility, so they're willing
                to take more risks. Once the fine threshold is where there is no illegal harvesting is overcome the
                villages all begin to harvest illegally again, steadily lessening as the impact of the fine is too
                great and they quit harvesting illegally (figures 5, 7, 8). Village 3 uniquely harvests illegal at fine
                &geq; 53, although it never surpassed 1 unit of wood, the quantity of wood kept creeping up higher
                and higher as with the fine (figure 8).</p>
            <p class="text">For villages with \(\alpha_i\) &lt; 0 , the opposite occurred, during those fine values in which the others did
                not harvest illegally, village 2's peak illegal harvesting behaviour occurred. Then descended to 0
                illegal harvest much quicker than the others at fine= 19. It is difficult to make an absolute
                observation for villages with \(\alpha_i\) &lt; 0 because there is only one village in this category and its
                behaviour is likely to be influenced by other parameters.</p>

                <p class="graphcap">Figure 10: The relationship between revenue at selling price per unit = 1 and fine = 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2</p>
            </div>

            <p class="text underimage">Revenue earned from selling each unit of wood for 1 is displayed in figure 10. The concavity in
                the line indicates that the utility payoff decreases with each additional unit of wood, and the
                greatest utility payoff at per unit value occurs at x+y-d= 1 (revenue= 0.63). Fine on the other
                hand increase linearly. From the graph we can see that when fine = 0.25 revenue and fine
                intersect at (3.921, 0.98) and fine= 0.5 intersects at (1.594, 0.797), fine=1, 2 do not intersect with
                revenue. Therefore when fine= 0.25 a village neither gains or loses anything if they illegally
                harvest up to 3.921 units of wood, and as the fine increases the quantity of wood that can be
                harvested without penalty quickly decreases.</p>
            <p class="text">It seems as though constants Income and Fee may have had an inverse effect on the decisionmaking
                of villages. For example village 3's balance of income-fee is greater than all others, but
                was the village likely to harvest illegally later on. Villages with a higher balance are expected to
                depend less on wood for income, and would therefore be less likely to harvest, but it seems as
                though because it’s balance was already most positive it was the village who could take the most
                financial risk. The outcomes do not suggest that Wood Per Trip (WPT) played a large role in
                dictating how much wood villages collected. Village 4 can carry 8 units of wood, but even when
                there was no fine for illegal harvesting they did not harvest more than 7.6 units of wood. The
                preference between woodlots depending on distance will be later dissected when reviewing the
                model itself.</p>
            <p class="text">Welfare comprises of two main components financial profit or loss and an altruism score, which
                does not help us understand how well or poorly villages are doing financially. Figure 11 (below)
                displays the average financial balance of the villages versus the average altruism score as fine
                increases. We can see that while altruism remains positive their average financial balance falls to
                -13.183 and constantly remains negative after fine= 0.5. Ultimately, if the villages cannot afford
                to live regardless of how well the environment or their neighbouring villages are doing they will
                never be happy.</p>

            <h3 class="sect1">6.1 Data Limitations</h3>
            <p class="text">Data used in this case study was pseudo randomly created in AMPL, and therefore does not
                mimic real data. Using a single demand unit for each village did not provide enough insight into
                their needs or their dependence on wood. We understood that villages that harvest wood
                sometimes do so to meet their own demands, and in other instances for economic income to
                support their families. Without having the real data we were not able to decipher between the
                different types of demand. Furthermore villages located near to urban cities are more likely to
                sell wood products, so their needs for wood are dictated by those of their customers. The data 
                needed to be expanded to create some variation or a probabilistic element to calculate the chance
                of needing more of less wood for each village. Additionally, those villages are subject to elastic
                demand, and the prices they sell units of wood for may change at any time. Data assigned to each
                village was done uniformly through a set minimum and maximum, because of this a village that
                received a low income also receive low demand, and a village that received higher income was
                also assigned higher demand. Chilongo (2014) and the World Bank (2020) explained that
                villages with lower incomes will have higher demands because they depend on forest products
                more. This relation between demand and income was not reflected in the data used and is likely
                to have affected the outcome.</p>
            <p class="text">Villages must pay a fee to be a part of the scheme. For many it is too expensive and so they
                choose to risk harvesting illegally. Regardless of if a village takes part in the community based
                system or not they all harvest from the same forest reserves, and therefore there is a chance that
                the supply allocated to a village within the system may have been previously harvested. The fees
                villages pay are dependent on the units and types of trees they demand. Our data was not
                segmented based on tree type and fee was not relative. We were not privy to details about tree
                supply density or village preferences for trees. To create competition amongst the villages so
                they can arrive at a Nash equilibrium we used k=N/2, but it is unknown to us how supply is
                segmented or accounted for.</p>
            <p class="text">We suspected that the distance of legal wood may impact illegal harvesting. Knowing that
                villages in the case study are within 5 kilometre from the forest reserves, we used that figure as
                an upper bound on the assigned distance from villages to forest data. This decision may have
                been shortsighted as the committee may not necessarily use the forested areas closest to the
                villages for allocation. The upper limit on maximum travel was meant to play a role in the
                decision making of the villages, but the distances between village and forest were all too similar
                and short. Not assigning any longer distances did not allow us to observe if a village was not
                pleased with the distance of legal wood allocated to them, or if they may have chosen to harvest
                illegally instead because the cost to travel for illegal wood was cheaper and worth the risk. Some
                of these data limitations were meant to be avoided by using GIS techniques to acquire the data,
                but due to time constraints they were not acquired.</p>


            <h3 class="sect1">6.2 Model Limitations</h3>
    
            <p class="text">Beginning with the objective functions' sub-equation <span class="ital">h<sub>1</sub></span>- concavity is a requirement of utility
                functions; that guided us to formulate <span class="ital">h<sub>1</sub></span> using \(1- \epsilon^{-\beta ( \sum_j(x_{ij}+y_{ij}-d_i))}\). In retrospect this may not
                have been the best method for achieving concavity as it created many limitations. Its main
                purpose was to understand how each villages utility increase as quantity of wood harvested
                increases. This calculation needed to include how much was earned from selling excess wood
                and how much was loss to paying fines for illegal harvesting and several other constants.
                Because of the initial sensitivity of exponential and its insensitivity to larger numbers we were
                limited to using \(\beta\) &lt; 1. When using a much larger selling price (\(\beta\)), revenue was already much too
                large for one unit of wood to provide the sensitivity needed from the <span class="ital">h<sub>1</sub></span> sub-equation. It also
                placed restrictions on the fine which is why it had to be placed outside of <span class="ital">h<sub>1</sub></span>. When fine was
                included in <span class="ital">h<sub>1</sub></span> it created a flaw to the model where even though villages did not harvest up to
                their legal amount (\(\overline x = x\)) they were harvesting illegally from the same area, because when
                scaled using the exponential the difference between 2 or 3 units of wood harvested illegally
                instead of legally became insignificant.</p>
            <p class="text">Villages are limited by the capacity of wood they can carry on each journey. The <span class="ital">h<sub>2</sub></span> sub-equation
                used for calculating travel cost did not round up the quantity of wood carried. This affected the
                overall out come in two ways: 1) travel costs were calculated incorrectly and were all cheaper
                than they should be and 2) the max travel constraint which uses the same equation without cost
                of fuel per kilometre calculated the distance traveled in proportion to how much wood was
                collected.</p>
            <p class="text">The original altruism and spitefulness utility function by Levine (1998) was meant to be used
                one-on-one, our adaption averaged the utility loss or gained by villages <span class="ital">i'</span> and also gave the
                opportunity to remove or place less importance on the utility gained from the harvest of village <span class="ital">i</span>.
                The altruism score is heavily skewed by village <span class="ital">i</span>'s gain, and in our opinion that encouraged
                village <span class="ital">i</span> to be behaviour more selfishly. Using = 0 we removed that portion of the altruism
                score, and were proven incorrect. From figures five through eight villages were more greedy
                when fines were lower and \(\delta\) = 0. By using \(\lambda\) rather than \(\lambda_i\) we grouped the outlook of villages on
                others. It would have been beneficial to use \(\lambda_i\) to see how the interactions behaviours may have 
                changed based on how each village felt towards another specifically. In a real situation all
                villages would not have the same opinions all at the same time.</p>
            <p class="text">Harvesting is performed cyclically, but the model was built for a one time use. Conserving and
                rebuilding the forests are acts that may take many decades, so it is crucial to understand the
                harvesting habits of the villages and how their needs change over time. The model did not have
                any components for this nor did we have access to this information. One of the most harmful
                limitations of the model is that supply needs to be greater than demand, rendering the model
                useless if there was a shortage. In order to aid in forest conservation the committee may
                sometimes limit the supply intended for that round of harvest regardless of demand. If the model
                cannot perform in this event then it is not that helpful to the committee.</p>


            <h3 class="sect1">6.3 Recommendations</h3>

            <p class="text">Computationally, the model is constrained to values of N &leq; 10. The simplest path to increase the
                value of N is using a computer with greater CPU and memory, which will also eventually be
                limited at some other greater value of N. Another option is for the committee to use a best
                response dynamics heuristic. The committee can first solve a relaxed version of the bilevel
                model, solving only for the committee's best case scenario using High Point Relaxation (HPR). As
                a starting point we can substitute the decision variable values from HPR into the bilevel model.
                Selecting a single village we fix the decision variables of all other villages, and optimise for the
                selected village. The new values of legal and illegal wood for the selected village are updated
                and become fixed. A second village is then selected and the same process is performed until all
                villages have been selected and no village has a strictly better solution than the current one. With
                this method each village chooses what is best for them at that time given what the others are
                doing seeking a pure Nash equilibrium (Roughgarden, 2013). If each village can continue to
                improve their outcome then an equilibrium is unachievable.</p>
            <p class="text">Another approach to finding estimated optimal solutions when branch-and-bound is infeasible is
                using heuristic search algorithms. Heuristic search algorithms are computationally cheaper to
                carry out in comparison to branch-and-bound, and the longer the system is left search the better
                the solution. Though this approach is only recommended when the value of N is large as
                heuristic search algorithms are not easy to formulate.</p>
            <p class="text">Ultimately, altruism cannot feed a family. A profit does, and combining altruism with financial
                welfare did not benefit the villages financially. The two sub-sections in the objective functions
                can be considered conflicting. On one hand villages want to prosper financially, and on the other
                they want to save the environment, but with their current habits they cannot do both. Altruism
                and financial welfare should not have been initially grouped into one function. Each
                programming model should have been made bi-objective and then using compromise
                programming formulation they could have been combined. The compromise programming
                approach was suggested by Zeleny (1982); it would allow the committee to find compromises
                amongst conflicting criteria. The merged objective function contains an 'ideal solution' or 'utopia
                point' <span class="ital">F<sup>*</sup><sub>N</sub></span> that will simultaneously optimise all of the original 
                <span class="ital">F<sub>N</sub></span> functions where <span class="ital">N</span>= 1,...,n. An
                'ideal solution' is obtained by optimising each <span class="ital">F<sub>N</sub></span> independently within a bounded set of
                alternatives, i.e. it is a compilation of all the singular objective functions. However, it is rare to
                have a single solution because there are usually trade-offs or compromises amongst the
                objectives. The merged objective function's goal is to minimise the distance of from the
                boundary of feasible solutions to the ideal solution (Chattopadhyay, 2001, Ringuest, 1992).</p>
            <p class="text">One of the limitations of using KKT reformulation for bilevel problems is that lower level
                problem cannot host binary variables. Yeu and You (2017) propose using optimal value
                reformulation and a decomposition algorithm which is capable of solving bilevel problems with
                binary variables in the lower level. As is, our model does not include villages who are not taking
                part in the community based system. It would be helpful if they could be included in the model
                so the committee can include their potential behaviour. A binary variable representing villages in
                the scheme or not in the scheme can be used in the lower level problems. Optimal value
                reformulation fixes the lower level problems' binary variables transforming it into a continuous
                convex model. Once in this form KKT conditions can be used to reformulate the followers'
                problems. Following reformulation, Yeu and You's (2017) decomposition algorithm uses partial
                enumeration which examines a portion of the followers discrete decisions at every iteration
                rather than using all combinations simultaneously. By using a subset of discrete decisions (and
                constraints) we attain a master problem that is a relaxation of the original. The relaxed problem's
                solution is used as an upper bound on the original problem which can then be solved for the
                leader.</p>
            <p class="text">Allocating wood to villages to limit how much is harvested is not enough to create sustainable
                harvesting practices. Harvesting occurs at a faster rate than the speed at which a tree can grow to
                its prime size. The Government of Malawi can use softwares such as <a href="http://capsis.cirad.fr">Capsis</a> 
                <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/fvs/">Forest Vegetation Similar</a>, and 
                <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/101/8/1125/160295">AmapSim</a>
                (to name a few) to simulate the growth of the diverse tree strands in the
                Namizimu Forest Reserve. Insight into tree growth can help with the selection of trees for
                harvest so they are harvested either at maximum height or whenever is most profitable.
                Furthermore, in the Indian state of Orissa, woodlots were established with the intent of reducing
                the strain on forests as they too were suffering from deforestation. K&#246;hlin and Park (2001) found
                that if placed the right distance from the village and forests, villagers will harvest from the
                woodlots rather than the forest. Having a dedicated space purely for cyclical tree growth and
                harvesting can ease deforestation.</p>

            <h3>7. Conclusion</h3>

            <p class="text">The purpose of this research was to use bilevel optimisation to assist with decreasing
                deforestation efforts and to allocate wood fairly to villagers, so they are discouraged from
                harvesting additional wood. We learned that fining villagers for illegal harvesting is helpful for
                averting such activity, but within the model it was assumed that all illegal harvesting is fined and
                that villagers do pay the amount that they owe. But, the reality is villagers are not always caught
                harvesting illegal and even when they are they may not be held accountable. Additionally,
                villagers never stole wood from other villagers in the optimisation model, because all villagers
                are aware of what was allocated to the others and for the leaders objective function to be
                maximised it was sensible for all villagers to harvest their allocated wood to meet their minimum
                demands. It is unknown to us to what the knowledge share would be like in the real situation and
                what it may trigger in villagers. For instance, if one village is spiteful towards another they may
                choose to harvest the other villages allocated wood if given that information.</p>
            <p class="text">The community based scheme needs to transition into a more inclusive format. As of now, it is
                too expensive for many villages to take part, even if they would like to. Villages may want to
                support government efforts to boost environmental conservation, but not if it means they will
                have to suffer for it. It may be beneficial for the committee to lower their fees so they can at least
                be more aware of the harvesting needs and habits of all villages within their authority.</p>
            <p class="text">The harvesting habits of the villagers are shaped by both their own needs as well as greater
                economic demands. It may be easier for the committee leaders to predict or regulate harvesting
                for subsistence living because village use will be more consistent and therefore easier to estimate
                how much is used during a given period. But, for those villages located near urban cities to
                whom they sell their harvest for income, demand can sometimes fluctuate in a less predictable
                manner. These same villages that sell wood for income are more reliant on forest products for a
                greater proportion of their total income. Committee leaders should gain a better understanding of
                each villages financial situation and their relationship with wood products. Within the bilevel
                model there can be an identifier which may be useful for assisting with fairer allocation based on
                the true needs of each village.</p>
            <p class="text">Optimising the allocation of wood to villages is not an isolated event, it lives in a greater
                ecosystem. There are many uncontrollable or uncountable variables when working with
                ecosystem problems that the optimisation models give false impressions on how much control
                we have. A better grasp of tree life cycles, spatial location constraints and the environmental
                effects of deforestation would be useful for building this system of equations in a more suitable
                manner. It is not possible to maximise each harvest unless we understand tree biodiversity- the
                different growth cycles, wood types, and how they translate into wood products. Unbeknown to
                us, it is likely the villages are already knowledge, and harvest different tree types based on their
                needs of timber and wood fuel. Further research into at what age each tree reaches its peak height
                or when it is most profitable to harvest would lead to optimal use of each tree, which would
                support less deforestation.</p>
            <p class="text">The Namizimu Forest Reserve is a mountainous region of 82,831 hectares; even with geographic
                information systems mapping support to analyse and document the landscape it is unlikely that
                we will ever be fully informed about it. The altitude of the taller regions has both pros and cons.
                It may be impossible for the government to protect the entire forest from illegal harvesting, but
                the higher altitudes may be naturally protected if they are inaccessible to villagers. Although, as
                the forest continues to shrinks and supply becomes more scarce villagers will venture further and
                take more risks to meet their demands.</p>
            <p class="text">If Malawians continue to rely on natural tree growth they will not be able to sustain long-term
                harvesting habits. We previously mentioned that population is expected to double in the next 19
                years, and demand for wood products is expected to follow. Both citizens and the Government of
                Malawi need to proactively increase supply to negate effects of harvesting on their forests if they
                are to support their increased demand in the future.</p>
            <p class="text">For this bilevel model to continue to aid in Malawi's fight against deforestation financial welfare
                and happiness (altruism score) should be measured separately. Although when combined, the
                altruism score had very little affect on the committee leaders allocation of wood decisions, it
                misrepresented the overall welfare of the villages. It was not until the two were separated (in
                figure 11) could we see how badly all the villages were suffering financially. Secondly, data
                should have been reviewed before finalising the model so that it could be built or adapted for
                realistic values. It was not until testing began with data we realised how limited we were and that
                the model as is may not be useful for real data points.</p>
            <p class="text">In summation, even though wood is allocated without any bias towards villages by using bilevel
                optimisation, it is not an environmentally sustainable approach, and using optimisation is
                nowhere near enough of an effort without other environmental approaches. The model can only
                produce optimal values for very small values of N, otherwise heuristics will have to be used to
                find a feasible outcome.</p>
