            <p class="text">Every Spring millions of students in the United States graduate from university to begin their first full time 
                jobs. A study conducted by the Wall Street Journal tracked which cities alumni from 445 universities moved to after graduation 
                and found that the 5 most popular cities amongst new graduates are: New York City, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Chicago, and 
                San Francisco<sup>1</sup>. Though each city is known for career opportunities and high salaries for young dream chasers, they are also 
                known for very high cost of living regionally and globally. <span class="bold">This presents the question: Can entry level 
                professionals afford to live in these cities?</span></p>

            <h3>Analysis of Data</h3>
            <p class="text">The pre-tax and post-tax salary data points were plotted on a scatter plot, box plot and density plot to provide 
                initial insight into the sample set (Graph A1). The strong linear relationship between the predictor: pre-tax salaries and 
                response variable: post-tax salaries became visible. While the box plot highlighted the outliers present within the sample set, 
                and the density plot revealed the severity of the left skew.</p>
            <p class="text">Because this study is focused on the likelihood of entry level graduates being able to afford their cities it 
                became evident that removing outliers is a priority because they were influencing the statistical parameters. Two methods 
                were tested: Cook's Distance and 1.5 x IQR, and the latter proved to be a better method for this test (Graph A2). Cook's 
                Distance demonstrated that some data points were highly influential on the regression model (and therefore to an extent 
                on statistical parameters). 1.5 x IQR improved the skew and symmetry of the sample set by removing the highest salaries 
                and the influence they had on the mean and variance.</p>
            <p class="text">Twenty outliers were removed from the tail-end of the sample set, and so the majority of change occurred in the 
                second half (after the median) of the data. The twenty outliers represented only 4% of the sample set but covered 1/3 of the 
                range in pre-tax salaries ($140,001 to $200,000). Their removal shrunk the average salary by $4,078, and the variance by 
                $6,824, tightening the model.</p>

                <h4>Comments About Data</h4>
                <p class="text">The salary data was acquired from Comparably.com<sup>3</sup>. Comparably mostly focuses on the technology industry, 
                    and it is reflected in the salary records. The data is crowdsourced and therefore there is room for error in the data 
                    (i.e. the record could be false). In the United States the technology industry is known for paying salaries higher than other 
                    industries - this means the sample set may inflate results.</p>
                <p class="text">The distribution of industries within each city differs greatly, and so these variations will also be reflected 
                    in the data (for example, NYC is ~30% tech salaries and SF ~70%).</p>
                <p class="text">In addition, each entry level professional may have their own unique background contributing to the large range in 
                    entry level salaries. These include past summer internships, a Master's degree vs a Bachelor's degree, the field of study, 
                    etc.</p>
                <p class="text">In the United States there are many deductions (for example: student loans, mortgage loans, number of dependents, 
                    etc.) that can be applied to reduce taxable income, but for this study a homogenous approach was taken and only the standard 
                    deduction of $12,200 USD was deducted.</p>

            <h3>Estimating Post-Tax Salary</h3>
            <p class="text">The post-tax salary is the amount a person has to live on, and so it is important to understand what percentage of 
                the offered pre-tax salary it is. In the United States there are 4 main types of income tax 4,5: federal, state, city, and FICA. 
                Excluding FICA, each has varying tax brackets that are calculated marginally based on pre-tax salary. This makes it difficult 
                for someone to quickly understand what their post-tax salary is when offered a compensation package. Using Simple Linear 
                Regression, a much easier method can be created to estimate post-tax salaries.</p>
            <p class="text">Graph 2 depicts trend lines for pre-tax and post-tax salaries and their relation to one another (salaries were placed 
                in ascending order and plotted in that order on the x-axis). The post-tax salary one can expect to earn is directly under the 
                pre-tax salary offered. Total income tax does not increase linearly - the graph displays a widening gap between the two trend 
                lines. That is, as salary increases the greater the percentage of one's salary will be paid in taxes. </p>

                <h4>Correlation</h4>
                <p class="text">The correlation between pre-tax and post-tax salary is 0.9973572. Due to the dependent nature of post-tax salaries 
                    on income this high positive correlation is expected.</p>

                <h4>Simple Linear Regression</h4>
                <p class="text">As there was only one predictor variable a simple linear regression model was generated to estimate post-tax 
                    salaries.</p>

                <p class="text underimage abovegraph ">Therefore, a simplified method for estimating post-tax salary is to take 63% of the offered salary 
                    + $9,000. For example, if Pre-Tax Salary = $150,000, then \(\hat y\)= 9000+ (0.63 *150000) = $103,755.</p>

                <p class="text">While F-Value, P-Value and R<sup>2</sup> provide insight into the entire model, each predictor variable is also

                    is only one predictor variable and so if the overall model is a strong fit so is the one variable: pre-tax salaries. The 
                    standard error tells us that on average there is a 0.2% error, so on average we should calculate between 63.336% to 62.9396% 
                    (which rounds to 63%).</p>

                <p class="text">Due to the large sample size and their range of values the variability represented in SST, SSE and SSR do not 
                    necessarily represent inaccuracy. From R<sup>2</sup> 99.47% of the variability has already been accounted for. Analyzing 
                    the mean standard error and residual values give a much better perspective of the errors and their variability with respect 
                    to the linear model.</p>
                <p class="text abovegraph">The mean squared error between a predicted post-tax salary and actual post-tax salary is $1,162, meaning that 
                    on average the standard error between the two values is approximately ± $34.09. To further analyse and understand the 
                    suitability of the regression model, the residual values between the sample mean of post-tax salaries and actual post-tax 
                    salaries within the sample set were plotted in Graph 5. Four distinct patterns can be spotted for each state with its own 
                    tax brackets: California (San Francisco & Los Angeles), Illinois (Chicago), New York (New York City), and Washington, DC. 
                    Unsurprisingly, the patterns within the residual plot indicate 1) a non-linear model may be more suitable and 2) each state 
                    should be modelled individually. Not only would modelling each state's taxes individually produce better results, but it 
                    makes more sense considering that a person only pays income tax for one state for a specific portion of their salary.</p>

                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p class="text">Taxes increase marginally and each state has its own set of tax brackets. Clustering sample data from 5 cities 
                    in 4 states still produced a regression model which estimated post-tax salaries with a low root mean squared error. The 
                    high correlation (0.9973572) between pre-tax salaries and post-tax salaries reveals that even though different states have 
                    different tax brackets, they are still similar. Due to the non-linearity of tax brackets a non-linear model and each state 
                    being modelled individually would have probably produced better estimates.</p>

            <p class="text">A new graduate is considered to be able to afford cost of living in their city if annual post-tax salary > average 
                cost of living. Of the 480 salary records within the sample set, 324 received a salary that afforded the person the cost of 
                living within the city they lived in.
                A 2-tailed Confidence Interval test at 90% confidence level was calculated to have a clearer understanding of which proportion 
                of new graduates can afford cost of living. Because it is unknown if there are false salary records in the sample set, only 90%

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="text">Salaries offered are often influenced by degree, industry, job title, location and many other factors. Even though 
                all records within this sample set are for entry level professionals, each may be entering the work force with their own unique 
                background. As such, a wide range of salaries is offered. Based on this sample set, approximately two-thirds of entry level 
                professionals can expect to earn above the average cost of living in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and 
                Washington, DC with an annual pre-tax salary between $45,001 and $55,000. Using the regression model: \(\hat y\) = 9029.9211 + 0.6315x 
                the respective estimated post-tax salary is between $37,350 and $43,650. Unfortunately for those choosing to move to New York City, 
                their chance of earning above the average cost of living is much lower than those who move to Chicago - 95% of new graduates in 
                Chicago earned above average cost of living, 72% in Los Angeles, 66% in Washington DC, 63% in San Francisco, and 41% in New York 
                City. The data within this sample set is crowdsourced and therefore there is room for error in the data set. The distribution of 
                industries is 1) heavily weighted towards the technology industry, 2) greatly differed across each city, for example: NYC is ~30% 
                tech salaries and SF ~70%. In the United States the technology industry is known for paying salaries higher than other industries. 
                All in all, <bold>the majority of new graduates CAN afford to live in the big cities</bold>, though due to the bias towards high salaries in 
                this sample set the results may be inflated.</p>
