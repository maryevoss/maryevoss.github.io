        <p class="text">The Falcon Heavy launch vehicle, designed to carry humans into space, does not reach the height necessary for 
            successful operations. Preliminary analysis has indicated that the issue stems from an underperforming first 
            stage, more precisely from a suboptimal flow of fuel into the combustion chamber of the rocket engine. <span class="bold">You 
            are tasked with optimising the fuel flow in order to maximise the height of the rocket at the end of the first 
            stage burn.</span></p>

    <section id="introduction">
        <h3 id="questionone">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="text">The Falcon Heavy rocket ship is being designed by SpaceX with the purpose of shuttling humans into space. Unfortunately it is not ready for its maiden voyage due to complications. During testing it was found that the rocket cannot achieve the height needed to become a successful mission. Upon further investigation it was discovered that the first stage burn is performing sub-optimally because of the fuel flow into the rocket engine's combustion chamber.</p>
        <p class="text">The affects of fuel flow on the maximum height of the rocket at the end of first stage burn can be understood by evaluating the following variables as they transition through time:</p>
        <p class="eq">height: [t<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>final</sub>] -> R</p>
        <p class="eq">velocity: [t<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>final</sub>] -> R</p>
        <p class="eq">mass: [t=<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>final</sub>] -> R </p>

        <p class="text">To do so, the first derivative of each  is calculated. From equation (1) height increases proportionally with velocity as time increases. (2)  is acceleration at time t,  and mass (3) is negatively proportional to thrust at time t. Lastly drag/friction is also relative to time, velocity and height:</p>

        <p class="eq1">\(h'(t) = v(t)\))<span id="rightside">(1)</span></p>
        <p class="eq1">\(v'(t) = {\theta(t)- D(h(t),v(t)\over m(t)}- ({h(0)\over h(t)})^2\)<span id="rightside">(2)</span></p>
        <p class="eq1">\(m'(t) = -2\theta(t)\)<span id="rightside">(3)</span></p>
        <p class="eq1">\(D(h(t),v(t)) := D_0 \times (v(t))^2 \times exp(-h_0 {h(t)-h(0)\over h(0)})\)<span id="rightside">(4)</span></p>

        <p class="text underimage">Where 't' is any given time within \([t_0, t_{final}]\). The rocket begins take off at t<sub>0</sub> and will finish firing at \(t_{final}\).</p>
        <p class="text">Ideally, there will only be a global solution (not multiple local optimal points), so using the second derivative convexity is tested. It can quickly be seen that <em>m''(t)&lt;0</em> inferring that the problem is non-convex.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="formulation">
        <h3>Formulation of Model</h3>
        <p class="text">As t<sub>final</sub> is unknown, there is no upper constraint on time and it is essentially infinite. This lack of boundary adds to the difficulties of finding an optimum solution as there are now also infinite decision variables. To overcome this, time is discretised into intervals using a parameter N, where t<sub>i</sub> = i/N * t<sub>final</sub>, for i= 0..N and t<sub>final</sub> = t<sub>N</sub>.</p>
        <p class="text">Another adjustment that will lessen the computational strain, the aforementioned functions (1-3) are converted into finite difference equations using numerical differentiation. The step lengths will be dictated by t<sub>final</sub>/N and will therefore change depending on N and t<sub>final</sub>. These transformations convert the problem into a nonlinear optimisation problem.</p>
        <p class="variables">Velocity: \(\overline v_k\) = velocity at k<sup>th</sup> time step for k=0..N</p>

        <p class="variables">Thrust: \(\overline \theta_k\) = thrust at k<sup>th</sup> time step for k=0..N</p>

       <h3>Brief Description On How It's Solved</h3> 
       <p class="text">
           Four different solvers are used within AMPL: LOQO, SNOPT, KNITRO, and MINOS. Each is
            known for its ability to solve local maxima/minima in nonlinear, non-convex optimisation
            problems.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            To initialise the model given starting points are inputted: \(t_{final}=1, \overline h_k=1, \overline \theta_k= \theta_{max}/2\), and the
            values N = 50, 100, 200, 400 are tested. Between the combinations of solvers and parameter N,
            there are 16 trials within the first round of testing.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Additionally, using a quadratic equation to describe the starting point of \(v(t)\) is the simplest
            polynomial order that can be used to represent the expected behaviour of velocity at times
            \(v(t=0)=0\) and \(v(t=t_{final})=0\), with there being a peak at step \(t=k\)could be 1,...,
            N-1). Therefore the given initial condition seems suitable and does not need to be changed. The
            starting point for mass, \(m(t)= 1+({t \over t_{final}})(0.6-1)\) indicates that mass burn is linear with time
            and ranges between 1 to 0.6.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Because the problem is non-convex, the starting points matter. A second round of 16 trials is then
            tested using the starting point \(t_{final}= 0.5\). All other starting points, N values and solvers from the
            first round are kept the same.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Data associated with time, velocity, height, mass and thrust are documented at each step for all
            trials. An emerging pattern demonstrated that trails with more steps (and shorter step lengths) had
            better results when using solvers SNOPT and KNITRO. This led to testing other combinations of
            starting points where \(\overline h_k=0.5\) and \(\overline \theta_k= \theta_{max}\). Other random starting points were tested, but results
            were never improved using them (so it seemed unnecessary to document them).
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            As the output of the objective will need to be rescaled to know the true height, the stopping criteria
            is set to 9 digits of accuracy: &epsilon; &le; .1e<sup>-8</sup> between the two highest heights. To analyse results data
            within each table were reviewed and various combinations of decision variables were plotted on 2D
            graphs.

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <section class="first16">
            <h4>Results for 16 Initial Trials</h4>
            <p class="text">
                When parameter <em>N</em> used higher values, \(\overline h_k\) was more likely to achieve greater heights for all solvers
            except for MINOS (which performed worse as <em>N</em> increased). For all 16 trials, the predictor variable
            'Thrust' was plotted against the response variable 'Height'. Visualising the data uncovered three
            phases, and two main types of patterns of fuel flow. Trials 7 (Figure 1) and 12 (Figure 2) are
            examples of the patterns (refer to table A1 to see starting points and solvers used) .
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                During the second phase of the burn, trial 12 displays a zig-zagging pattern between maximum and
                zero fuel burn. Trial 7 has a more stable second phase where fuel burn gradually increases. When
                comparing the two types of patterns there was no identifiable trend in which performed better.
                Lastly, height differs by 0.001438158 units between the highest and lowest heights; that is Trial 3's
                max height is 11.2038% (to 4dp) less than Trial 12's.

            <p class="text">
                Height does not increase linearly with time, and smaller step sizes \((t_{final}/N)\) generally lead to a better
                outcome. Since the starting points are important to finding a local maxima, various were tested.
                Initiating \(\theta\) at \(\theta_{max}\) had the most impact on increasing height, whereas \(t_{final}\) and \(\overline h_k\) did not improve
                the objective function as much (can be seen in rows 2 to 4 of Table 1). Table 1's results show that
                the combination of starting points for trial 39 has highest max \(\overline h_k\).

            <h4>Results from Trial 39</h4>
            <p class="text">The rate of fuel flow can be observed in 3 main stages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="text">The rocket takes off a full throttle (max fuel flow) to get off the ground, thrust is constant
                    and velocity is quickly picking up during this period.</li>
                <li class="text">The fuel flow is optimised to overcome the increase in drag due to increasing velocity and
                    height. Fuel flow drops significantly to &asymp;2.1 and gradually increases to 3.1 within 0.5 time
                    units. Increase in velocity slows down a bit during this initial transition, then ramps up until
                    the fuel is finished.</li>
                <li class="text">The rocket continues to rise while decelerating due to drag, which continues for 63.25% of
                    steps.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Actionable Recommendations</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="text">Because the problem is non convex, the solution found is a local maxima and not necessarily a
                global maximia, research should be done to confirm that it is a viable solution to the problem.</li>
            <li class="text">Testing a wider range of solvers, and values for parameter N</li>
            <li class="text">Is max thrust limited by physical infrastructure? The rate of fuel flow, especially within the first
                phase of take off is important to achieving a maximum heigh, experimentation should be done
                with a max thrust > 3.5</li>
            <li class="text">Within this model throttle was able to change infinitely, but real engines do not respond that
                way. Additional constraints should be added for the max change in throttle between time steps.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="suggestions">
        <h3>Suggestions for Further Investigations</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="text">It was previously mentioned that fuel burn performs linearly to thrust, but engines are more
                likely to have non-linear relationship between thrust and fuel burn rate. Further test should be
                carried out to understand how the engine performs then rewrite the formula to more accurately
                predict how it performs.</li>
            <li class="text">Though recommended action #2 is testing different values of N, consideration must be taken to
                ensure that the step length is not too small or too large as they can cause zero values within the
                finite differences calculations or the estimate of the slope of the tangent may be less accurate.</li>
            <li class="text">The computational time of this model was rather short, meaning that a more robust model that
                may need more computational time and power can be used to estimate height</li>
        </ol>
