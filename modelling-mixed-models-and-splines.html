        <p class="text space">When the observed and fitted values are compared it is clear that the predicted lines simply connect the first
            and last observed value for each region. Observed life expectancy does not increase linearly, and wavers a lot
            during the 21 year period. Therefore the selected model from no.3 is not appropriate for predicting the year
            to year life expectancy changes.</p>

            lower life expectancy compared to other regions and their growth of life expectancy also occurs at a much
            slower rate. Conversely, regions 204, and 272 perform best, both beginning at higher life expectancy in 1990
            and having faster growth than many others. Though regions 664, 244, and 205 have very average life
            expectancy in 1990 their average year over year growth is much better than the others.</p>

            not experience as much growth compared to other regions over the 21 year period. Even though region 268
            has not experienced the most growth in life expectancy, it was still above average, and combined with the
            highest life expectancy at year 0 it had the second highest in year 2010, which is why it still performs best.</p>

            the weight drops below 10, and mostly wavers between a weight of 0 and 5 after 20 degrees (with few exceptions). 
            Generally lower temperatures yield higher weights.</p>

        <p class="text">Albeit not precise, the splines do roughly characterise the relationship between weight and temperature. 
            The peaks are in similar positions to the actual max; but both peak early and do not raise as high as the actual peak. 
            The regression lines fit within the 95% confidence intervals. The confidence intervals are much wider before and 
            after the incline and decline towards and from the peak. When they are narrower the predicted weights of crystals 
            are more likely to be accurate in comparison to the wider confidence intervals. As the degrees of freedom has 
            increased oscillation has become visible. </p>

        <p class="text">Some of the issues spotted in Figure S2 appear to have been fixed by using a natural cubic spline with 9 df. 
            The predicted peak weight of crystals is much more accurate with the lower and upper confidence intervals containing the 
            actual peak, and the range of weights around peak temperature. The oscillation visible in the 5 knot cubic spline, is 
            not visible here, and the confidence intervals before and after the peak on the inclining and declining slopes are much 
            more narrow suggesting more accuracy of the regression line within those ranges of temperature.</p>

            5.25 df), its peak reaches further towards the max, but still does not reach the cluster of highest weights. At 21 df, 
            the smoothing spline best fits temperatures <&lt;20 degrees, but begins to oscillate after this temperature. Oscillation 
            became visible at 10.5 df and became worse at degrees of freedom increased.  The smoothing spline with 21df though
