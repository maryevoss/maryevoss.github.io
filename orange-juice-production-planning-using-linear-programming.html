        <section class="problem">
            <h2 id="probsol">Problem Brief</h2>
            <p class="text">You have been assigned to provide analytics experience to the company UniCitrus. UniCitrus is a major producer of 
                frozen concentrated orange juice in Brazil. Three orange varieties are used: Hamlin, Pera, and Valence. The company 
                buys the production from selected orange plantations, picks the fruits, processes it into juices, and blends them 
                into two products called Standard and Dairy. The Standard juice is primarily used by beverage industries all over 
                the world. The slightly more expensive Dairy has to satisfy certain conditions on flavour, acidity, and colour, 
                among others. The planning horizon is 3 months. Tasks to be completed:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="text"><span class="bold">Determine a production plan that maximises the company's net profit during the planing 
                    horizon.</span> Juice inventories are negligible at the beginning go the planning horizon.</li>
                <li class="text">Capacity limitations of the juice plant were ignored in part 1; <span class="bold">revise the model to take 
                    into account</span> the following <span class="bold">capacity constraints.</span> The equipment at the plant 
                    can process 0.5 million boxes of Pera oranges per month if this is the only variety processed. Hamlin oranges 
                    use 10% more capacity, and Valencia oranges use 10% less capacity. The effective plant capacity will therefore 
                    depend on the proportions of the different varieties processed.</li>
                <li class="text">Orange growers in northern Brazil produce a lot of Valencia oranges. A truckload of Valencia oranges consists of 
                    1000 boxes. Let \(\lambda\) denote the cost for purchasing and transporting a truckload of oranges from the north 
                    to the juice plant. <span class="bold">Evaluate the effects of increasing the availability of Valencia oranges on

            <h3 id="questionone">Introduction</h3>
            <p class="text">UniCitrus, a producer of frozen concentrated orange juice in Brazil, has requested a predictive analysis of 
                the maximum net profit they can earn during a 3 month planning horizon. UniCitrus has provided the demand they have 
                projected for the two juice types they produce, Standard and Dairy, in Table 1, as well as each juice's selling price. If 
                demand is fully met, there is the potential to earn &pound;3,140,000 in revenue (even though UniCitrus has stated that it is not 
                necessary for all demand to be met). To produce the two juice types UniCitrus uses 3 varieties of oranges - Hamlin, Pera, 
                and Valencia; the current expected availability (supply) is listed in Table 2. The cost to purchase and transport each box 
                of oranges is &pound;1. However, each box of orange variety has a different weight, so the cost per tonne for each variety differs 
                with Pera costing &pound;270.27/tonne, then Hamlin at &pound;285.71/tonne, and Valencia at &pound;294.18/tonne</p>

            <h3>Solution Description</h3>
            <h4>Task 1</h4>
                <p class="text">To solve Task 1's objective function, 3 primary variables were established to calculate the optimum combination 
                    of juice in tonnes: i) <span class="ital">x</span> - juice sold to meet that month's demand ii) <span class="ital">y</span> - quantity of oranges converted into juice that month, 
                    and iii) <span class="ital">i</span> - portion of juice produced in advance and held in inventory to meet the following month's demand. To simplify 
                    calculations, all units were converted into tonnes to align with using 'juice sold in tonnes' in the revenue prediction. 
                    Additionally, a constraint was created for boxes to be purchased per thousand boxes (because it would be unlikely that a 
                    large-scale juice producer would purchase supply per box).</p>
                <p class="text">UniCitrus sells its products by the tonne, therefore within each batch of juice the mixed orange varieties used 
                    need not be an integer, but the summed values within the batch has to be a whole number (abiding by the no waste policy). 
                    Due to supply limitations of Valencia oranges it was clear from the start that it would not be possible to produce Dairy 
                    Juice in Month 1, and so meeting all demand was not a primary concern. Lastly, to optimize the use of the juice plant a 
                    supplementary goal of producing juice to meet demand in as few months as possible was implemented.</p>
            <h4 class="underimage">Task 2</h4>
                <p class="text">Introduced a new constraint - production capacity for each orange variety. The capacity constraint needed 
                    to be accounted for both vertically (within each orange variety) and horizontally (across all varieties). Capacity 
                    constraints were converted into tonnes to match the metrics of the existing model.</p>
            <h4 class="underimage">Task 3</h4>
                <p class="text">A new source for Valencia oranges became available, presenting the opportunity to meet all demand. Because purchasing and 
                    transportation cost \(\lambda\) is unknown, the two sources of Valencia oranges are treated independently within the 
                    supply matrix. Contrarily, the two sources are treated as one for mixture and processing constraints.</p>
                <p class="text">It is assumed that this new supply of Valencia oranges is bountiful and therefore a redundant constraint. Our new goal is 
                    to observe the effects of \(\lambda\) on maximising net profit. Though it is evident that net profit will attain maximum 
                    value when \(\lambda\)=0, we will scrutinize the relationship between net profit and \(\lambda\) as it increases.</p>

                <p class="text underimage">The introduction of \(\lambda\) has also impacted the purchasing distribution amongst the orange varieties. 
                    Graph 2 demonstrates the pivotal changes for quantities of northern Brazilian Valencia oranges purchased. In Month 1, 
                    UniCitrus does not have an alternative source of Valencia oranges; if they are to meet all demand, they must purchase 
                    oranges from the new source. Meanwhile in Month 2, there is an alternative option for Valencia oranges. These two cases 
                    provide enough information to understand the full effects of \(\lambda\) on purchasing distribution.</p>
                <p class="text">In Month 1, when \(\lambda\) &lt; 919 it is more profitable to use the upper bound mixing percentage constraint 
                    for Valencia oranges in both juice types, because the new source of Valencia oranges is cheaper per tonne than any of 
                    the other varieties. Once \(\lambda\) exceeds 919 it becomes more expensive than purchasing Pera oranges, so we see the 
                    distribution shift towards the use of Pera oranges. Similarly, at \(\lambda\)=975, Hamlin oranges have a higher yield of 
                    weight/&pound; than Valencia oranges, further reducing the quantity of northern Valencia oranges purchased. Shortly after when 
                    \(\lambda\)=1000, both sources of Valencia oranges cost the same, therefore no preference is given to either source 
                    (since their effects on net profit are equivalent). Up until \(\lambda\)=1460 in Month 1, it is beneficial for UniCitrus 
                    to continue purchasing at least the minimum amount of Valencia oranges needed to meet all of Dairy demand. As \(\lambda\) 
                    increases past that amount, it is best for UniCitrus to continue purchasing Valencia oranges to meet a decreasing portion 
                    of Dairy demand. Lastly at \(\lambda\)= 19,441 Dairy production ceases as it is no longer profitable to purchase Valencia 
                    oranges</p>
                <p class="text">It is important to note that the purchasing decisions of orange varieties to maximize net profit is not 
                    solely dictated by their prices, but is also influenced by processing, mixing, and purchasing constraints.</p>

            <ol>
                <li class="text">Purchasing valencia oranges from the northern supplier will result in increased profits for UniCitrus if 
                    \(\lambda\) &lt; 19441. UniCitrus should use Table A1 as a guideline for acceptable prices per truckload, and the identified 
                    number of truckloads that should be purchased at those prices.</li>
                <li class="text">A more accurate prediction for Net Profit could be determined if UniCitrus segmented their monthly cost rather 
                    than presenting them in one lump sum (i.e. cost of running the juice plant at &pound;500,000/month). In the model built, inventory 
                    replaces the need to run production every month, but it is unlikely that there would not be any expenses during those months. 
                    For example, members of the workforce will still need to be present to complete tasks such as managing inventory to meet 
                    demand.</li>
                <li class="text">The supply of northern Brazilian Valencia oranges is bountiful, and can potentially supply enough oranges to meet 
                    demand for all 3 months of production. UniCitrus should utilize their current cost for Valencia oranges to leverage a lucrative 
                    deal with the new suppliers. If UniCitrus can negotiate for \(\lambda\) &lt; 1000, then it would be sensible to purchase all 
                    Valencia oranges from the new supplier. But, if \(\lambda\) \(\geq\) 1000 UniCitrus should maintain their original source and 
                    only use the new Valencia if the initial supplier cannot meet their demands.</li>
                <li class="text">Currently, Pera oranges are priced lowest per tonne, and Standard juice can be produced using only Pera oranges. 
                    If UniCitrus can source another supplier of Pera oranges who will charge the same or lower rate for Pera oranges, UniCitrus 
                    can increase net profit.</li>
                <li class="text">If the juice plant is running it must perform at full capacity. This recommendation requires many other adjustments 
                    that need further investigation, such as increasing supply and demand, a longer inventory period and manufacturing cycle.</p>
                <li class="text">If UniCitrus secures a contract for northern Brazilian Valencia oranges when \(\lambda\) &lt; 919, then they should 
                    experiment with changing the mixture constraints to favour Valencia oranges. This will also maximise the amount of juice produced 
                    with current production capacity.</li>
                <li class="text">Store inventory for oranges (not just juice). This way, excess supply can be stored for future demand, protecting 
                    UniCitrus from the case of, 'if a variety is not available one month and there was a high supply in previous months, and 
                    production capacity was met during those months it would still be possible to meet demand that would not have been otherwise 
                    met.'</li>

            <h3>Further Investigation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="text">In the current model, inventory is stored for one month. It would be prudent to learn (or for the analyst to be 
                    given access to such information) the shelf life of the juices, so that the model can be recreated to hold inventory for longer 
                    than a month or establish a steady inventory cycle.</li>
                <li class="text">The 3-month planning horizon provided is insufficient for optimising the use of the juice plant. It would be 
                    better to analyse at least a year's worth of data to understand the ebbs and flows of supply and demand. This information 
                    will aid in planning what the length of the manufacturing cycle, inventory cycle, and ensuring production period operate 
                    at full capacity, which will further decrease cost/tonne of juice produced.</li>
                <li class="text">UniCitrus should provide their past demand data, as it is possible that they are conservative in their demand 
                    projections. Because UniCiturs does not always operate at full capacity each month, the per tonne cost of production varies 
                    month to month. If is possible to increase demand it may be possible to lower and regulate the cost to produce each tonne 
                    by operating at full capacity during months of production.</li>
                <li class="text">Assuming UniCitrus has been conservative while setting demand projections, and only produces juice to meet 
                    that demand, they are potentially losing out on higher revenue and profit. In this scenario the juice plant is not 
                    operating at full capacity, so we perform a cost benefit analysis of oversupply. The juice plant runs at a fixed cost 
                    each month, and so there is no variation in cost for running the plant at full capacity vs partial capacity. Therefore, 
                    if the factory is running at partial capacity and is increased to full capacity the only cost incurred would be cost to 
                    purchase and transport oranges and inventory. The average cost to purchase a tonne of oranges = &pound;283.37, and the 
                    cost to inventory a tonne of juice each month= &pound;10. Therefore, the average cost to oversupply is &pound;283.37 + 
                    &pound;10<span class="ital">m</span> (<span class="ital">m</span> for # of months stored), and the average to cost 
                    undersupply is &pound;1050 - (&pound;283.37 + &pound;10m). Ultimately, it seems as though UniCitrus is losing more 
                    undersupplying.</li>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="text">In summary, it is profitable for UniCitrus to purchase the suggested quantity (can be found in Appendix: Table A1) 
                of Valencia oranges from the new sources as long as \(\lambda\) &lt; 19441. As depicted previously, there is an inverse 
                relationship between the sensitivity of net profit and \(\lambda\), with there being two critical points segmenting net 
                profit's sensitivity into thirds: \(\lambda\) &lt; 975 is highly sensitive, 975 &leq; \(\lambda\)&lt; 19441 is mildly sensitive, 
                and \(\lambda\) \(\geq\) 19441 becomes immune. Likewise, major changes in purchasing distribution occur at the same values. Finally, 
                if UniCitrus provides a breakdown of their expenses and historical supply and demand data a more accurate prediction for 
                net profit can be modeled</p>
