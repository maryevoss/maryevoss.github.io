                    different scale. Within 2 years (2014 to 2016) the number of deaths per annum due to HIV fell by over 50% for both genders. It is 
                    important to note that death is impacted by factors such as past diagnoses, CD4 levels at diagnosis, and quality of treatment</p>

                <h4>CD4 Levels at Diagnosis</h4>
                <p class="text">Approximately 47% of HIV cases are diagnosed when CD4 levels are dangerously low (below 350). The worst case occurred in Wales in 
                    2011, when 59% of HIV diagnoses had CD4 levels below 350, and in the best circumstances in Northern Ireland in 2015 when 27% of 
                    HIV diagnoses had CD4 levels below 350. The varying lengths of the interquartile ranges for the different regions demonstrate how 
                    inconsistent regions are at identifying HIV. Generally, London has diagnosed HIV positive persons when their CD4 levels are higher 
                    than 350, which gives them a better survival rate. Conversely, Wales is almost always worse than average, but did improve in 2014 
                    by spotting 60% of new cases before CD4 levels dipped below 350.</p>

                <p class="text">The relationship between MTC transmission and diagnosis under age 15 shows us how many children living with HIV are unaware of their 
                    condition, as they have either not yet been diagnosed or were diagnosed at a much later age even though they contracted HIV pre/post 
                    birth. In cities where there are fewer cases of HIV, medical doctors have been better at catching HIV early; in contrast, larger 
                    cities such as London were more likely to leave cases undiagnosed. This could be because the doctors were unaware of the mother's 
                    HIV status.</p>

                <p class="text">86.5% of cases during 2009 to 2018 HIV was contracted through behavioural exposure (either from sex between men or heterosexual contact). 
                    The graphs below show how these two subcategories of exposure compared to one another for new HIV cases over the years. In many regions 
                    sex between men and heterosexual contact are equally responsible for spreading HIV, although over time the portion due to sex between 
                    men grows (and in most regions outweighs heterosexual contact). Unlike the majority of the UK, heterosexual contact is the main cause 
                    of spreading HIV within the Midlands and East of England. This growing concentration of HIV contact from sex between men correlates to 
                    why new cases of HIV are continuously more likely to be from men than women.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p class="text">The overall HIV climate has shown significant improvement over the last 10 years. Deaths due to HIV and new diagnoses per annum have notably 
                decreased, whilst an upsurge transpired in those receiving the needed healthcare. The year-over-year gains of treatment numbers can be 
                attributed to advancements in medication, which in conjunction with the dwindling number of new cases also directly relates to shrinking 
                death rates. If the number of new cases continues to decrease we can expect to see treatment numbers wane in the future. Even though HIV is 
                generally declining, the Gender Distribution graphs reveal that it is not doing so equally between men and women. The shifts towards a 
                greater percentage of cases coming from men can be attributed to the rising percentage of HIV exposure through sex between men. Like gender, 
                the distribution amongst age groups is disproportionate - the three youngest age group account for lesser cases, while also shrinking over 
                time. One speculation is that these age groups are continuously becoming more aware and educated about HIV. Unfortunately, 47% of the time 
                HIV goes unnoticed until CD4 levels are already below 350. It is difficult to specify a reason as to why people are diagnosed so late, as 
                there are many potential factors. For example, in the case of Mother To Child transmission, mothers of children who aren't diagnosed until 
                later on in life may not have been aware that they were carrying HIV while pregnant. Overall, people with HIV need to be accurately diagnosed 
                sooner, as this will not only improve the individual's chance of survival, but also increase awareness and potentially prevent further spread 
                of HIV.</p>
